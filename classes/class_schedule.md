# Class Schedule - Startup Studio: AI-Accelerated Building & Validation

**Course:** Startup Studio: AI-Accelerated Building & Validation
**Instructors:** Lydia Chilton (Sponsoring Professor) & Ken St. Clair (Adjunct Assistant Professor)
**Semester:** Spring 2026

---

## Course Milestones

The course follows the canonical validation sequence: **Problem → Solution → Demand → Build.** Every major startup framework converges on this order — Lean Startup, Customer Development, The Mom Test, Running Lean. Teams that skip stages or do them out of order build things nobody wants.

### EXPLORE (Weeks 1-2)
> Discover problems worth solving. Meet potential teammates.

- Speed dating with classmates
- Brainstorm problems and personas
- Learn Fermi estimation for market sizing

### FORM (Week 3)
> Lock in your team and problem space.

- Form teams of 4-5
- Divergent+Convergent thinking exercises
- Generate multiple ideas before committing

### PROBLEM + SOLUTION VALIDATION (Week 4)
> Talk to real people. Is this problem real? Does your solution idea resonate?

- Problem interviews — talk to 5+ potential users
- Include solution signal questions at the end of each interview (pitch the concept, gauge reaction, ask for commitments)
- Define your target audience from interview learnings
- **Checkpoint:** Do people have this problem, and does your proposed solution excite them?

### SOLUTION VALIDATION (Week 5)
> Propose a solution and stress-test it before spending money.

- Generate multiple brand positioning options with AI
- Test positions against synthetic user personas (built from real interview data, confidence metrics)
- Build landing page using the positioning that resonates most
- Refine into one strong version
- **Checkpoint:** Does this solution resonate with the people who have the problem?

### DEMAND VALIDATION (Week 6)
> Drive real traffic. Will strangers express interest?

- Drive traffic to landing page (social channels + paid ads)
- Collect waitlist signups / demand signals
- Analyze results, iterate on page as needed
- **Checkpoint:** Will strangers pay attention and sign up?

### BUILD (Weeks 7-8)
> Start building for real. MVP by spring break.

- Build the real product — with AI-accelerated development, basic workflows can ship fast
- For problems you can't solve immediately (marketplace cold-start, algorithm building), use Wizard of Oz or concierge techniques to fake the hard parts
- Run experiment 2 (new channel, pricing test, or social validation)
- **MVP Presentations** before spring break (peer feedback)
- *Spring Break*

### ITERATE + SCALE (Weeks 9-11)
> Second experiment cycle. Keep building. Extra week for depth.

- Post-break check-in and experiment planning
- Run experiment 3
- Iteration sprint / experiment 4
- Analytics deep dive
- **Feature freeze** end of Week 11

### MEASURE + NARRATIVE (Week 12)
> Product is frozen. Collect your results for Demo Day.

- Final measurement round (usage data, quotes, metrics — product doesn't change)
- Build pitch narrative from experiment results
- **Checkpoint:** What's the story your data tells?

### SHIP (Weeks 13-15 + Finals)
> Tell your story. Demo Day.

- Build presentations and pitches
- Pitch workshop with peer feedback
- Practice rounds and dress rehearsal
- **Demo Day: ~May 12** (Finals period, date/venue TBD)

## Experiment Checkpoints

Teams run structured experiments throughout the course:

| Week | Phase | Experiment | Key Question |
|------|-------|------------|--------------|
| 4 | **Problem** | Problem Interviews | Do people actually have this problem? |
| 5 | **Solution** | Synthetic Pre-flight | Does our proposed solution resonate with target personas? |
| 6 | **Demand** | Demand Test (traffic → waitlist) | Will strangers express interest? |
| 7-8 | **Build** | Experiment 2 (team's choice) | Can we validate a second dimension? (pricing, channel, feature) |
| 8 | **Build** | MVP Presentations | Is our solution coherent? (peer feedback) |
| 9-10 | **Build** | Experiment 3 (team's choice) | Can we improve on earlier results with a more built product? |
| 11 | **Scale** | Experiment 4 / deep iteration | Can we push further with extra build time? |
| 12 | **Measure** | Final Measurement | What story does our data tell? (product frozen, collect pitch data) |

## Phase Details

### Weeks 1-2: Explore
*Shopping period — students may still be joining/leaving*

- **c1w1** (Jan 22): Course intro, instructor intros, speed dating, problems brainstorm
- **c2w2** (Jan 27): Repeat intros for new students, speed dating, personas brainstorm
- **c3w2** (Jan 29): HW review, Fermi estimation for audience sizing

### Week 3: Form
- **c4w3** (Feb 3): Team formation
- **c5w3** (Feb 5): Divergent thinking, idea generation

### Week 4: Problem + Solution Validation
- **c6w4** (Feb 10): Problem + solution interviews — problem discovery first, then pitch concept and gauge reaction
- **c7w4** (Feb 12): Define target audience from interview learnings

### Week 5: Solution Validation
- **c8w5** (Feb 17): Generate brand positions with AI → test with synthetic user pre-flight (personas from interview data, 50 iterations, confidence metrics) → build landing page with winning position
- **c9w5** (Feb 19): Analyze pre-flight results, refine into one strong landing page

### Week 6: Demand Validation
- **c10w6** (Feb 24): Drive traffic to landing page (social channels + paid ads) → collect waitlist signups. Hand out dev workflow one-sheet
- **c11w6** (Feb 26): Analyze demand test results, iterate on page if not converting. Note: changing things over time is not clean experimentation, but startup reality — teach this tension explicitly

### Weeks 7-8: Build
- **c12w7** (Mar 3): Start building real product. WoZ/concierge only for hard problems (cold-start, algorithms). 10-min dev workflow intro
- **c13w7** (Mar 5): Build sprint. Design and launch experiment 2

- **c17w10** (Mar 31): Run experiment 3
- **c18w10** (Apr 2): Analyze experiment 3 results, iterate

### Week 11: Scale
- **c19w11** (Apr 7): Iteration sprint / experiment 4 — extra build time to go deeper
