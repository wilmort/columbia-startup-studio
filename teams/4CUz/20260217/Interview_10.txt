Right. 

Daniel Kim
I'm major in computer science. 

You
Um, do you use social media? Right. 

Daniel Kim
I do, yes. 

You
What app do you use the most? 

Daniel Kim
Uh, I would say TikTok or maybe 

You
Oh. 

Daniel Kim
YouTube, one of the 

You
Do 

Daniel Kim
two. 

You
you know how much time you spend on the apps? You 

Daniel Kim
I have no idea, actually, to be honest. 

You
have no idea. Do you have any estimation on top of your head? 

Daniel Kim
Probably a long ass time come 

You
Okay, 

Daniel Kim
here. 

You
um, so what time of the day do you usually use it in the morning at night, at lunch or whatever? 

Daniel Kim
Um, 

You
In 

Daniel Kim
yeah, I use it at, like, in the afternoon 

You
the 

Daniel Kim
and 

You
afternoon? 

Daniel Kim
also at 

You
I say. 

Daniel Kim
night. So late. 

You
Um, do 

Daniel Kim
Yeah. 

You
you usually do it? Uh, indoors, outdoors or anywhere? 

Daniel Kim
A lot of the time it's 

You
Oh. 

Daniel Kim
indoors. When I'm 

You
I 

Daniel Kim
outdoors, it's like I'm doing other things. 

You
see. Um, is there any occasion that you mostly use it for, like, you know, on the subway when you're, like, reading a book, like, you're doing homework, like, you're doing lecture? Yeah. 

Daniel Kim
Uh, yeah, either, I use it when I'm on the subway or when I'm trying to like kill time 

You
Oh, 

Daniel Kim
or like 

You
I see. Okay. 

Daniel Kim
indoors. 

You
Do you 

Daniel Kim
Yeah. 

You
have any knowledge of what triggered you to open the app? 

Daniel Kim
Um. I think boredom probably. 

You
Hmm. 

Daniel Kim
So, like, I'll, like, be doing something and then I'll get like, I'll be like, oh, like, or like, I'll, I'll be doing nothing and I'll be 

You
I 

Daniel Kim
like, I want to do something else or something, right? 

You
see. Do you think your habit of scrolling interfere with work, study, sleep, or anything that's like from your 

Daniel Kim
Uh-huh. 

You
habit? 

Daniel Kim
Scrolling, interviews, with my some habits. 

You
Yeah, like, yeah, your normal habits. 

Daniel Kim
I would say 

You
Hmm. 

Daniel Kim
no, because I do it like at night or I'm like, uh, right before I go, or like, when I'm on like the subway, do anything, eventually. 

You
I see. Have you ever try stopping or limiting yourself on scrolling social media? No, 

Daniel Kim
Um, no, I'm not. 

You
you're not. Okay. So like, let me ask you this. Usually how do you stop yourself from using the app, like you just like, turn it off, like with your mental, saying like, okay, I need to turn it off, or you use some kind of like app to help you with that? 

Daniel Kim
Um, most of the time I mental it. I'm just like, uh, I'm gonna turn it off now. I 

You
Hmm. 

Daniel Kim
need to stop now. Or 

You
I 

Daniel Kim
like, oh, it's been like, it's been too long then I need to chill. 

You
say, can you imagine yourself without social media at all? 

Daniel Kim
Um, I mean, yeah, 

You
I 

Daniel Kim
if I 

You
see. 

Daniel Kim
had to. 

You
Mm, okay. Wow. So here are some, what's it called? We have some solutions, that, you know, to mitigate the problem for, like, minus scrolling, and 

Daniel Kim
Yeah. 

You
then you're gonna just tell us, like, how do you think about this kind of solution? So one of them is you, we having an educational summary app, for example, like a new source, right? Or something about like community science topic that you might be interested in and you scroll onto that thing onto that topic. So it just basically the idea of replacing social media with like, current topic, you know? Yes, 

Daniel Kim
Mm, okay. 

You
so would you think those are like something you are willing to replace whatever content you're having on social media like TikTok? 

Daniel Kim
Um, so, wait, is it, like, uh, current events in my, like, major, basically, is that what 

You
Yeah, 

Daniel Kim
you're saying? 

You
yeah, yeah, yeah 

Daniel Kim
Um, yeah, that'd be pretty cool. I mean, I think if I did replace it. 

You
Mm-hmm. 

Daniel Kim
I would probably spend significant less time just because, like, 

You
Mm-hmm. 

Daniel Kim
there's not much, like, I don't know, not too much depth in it or whatever. 

You
I see. I mean, would you think that, um, you would just use that kind of app to scroll on like educational topic compared to, you know, the fun content totally. Are you just still gonna come back to um, TikTok, for example. Mm. 

Daniel Kim
I think it truly depends on like what the vibe is, like if I'm feeling, if it's like, or like, I don't know, maybe it depends on like 

You
Mm-hmm. 

Daniel Kim
how 

You
I 

Daniel Kim
good the educational content is, if you do what I mean. 

You
see, I know what you mean. Okay. So how about, like, there's another solution. That is like, we prevent you from using social media, such as we ask you to say, oh, you doing homework, right? And you want to go back onto social media, you just scan the homework and give us proof that, oh, you are doing the work that you need to do. So that you can get it on. Yeah, 

Daniel Kim
Oh. 

You
how about that one? Like, do you think it's useful at all for you? Or you think it's just like, yeah. Annoying. 

Daniel Kim
See, I think I could probably do it. 

You
Mm-hmm. 

Daniel Kim
It would probably just be annoying if you like, though. 

You
I see, I see. Um, and uh, would you feel comfortable with like sharing, you know, screen time with your friends, like a group of friends that you trust? Oh, 

Daniel Kim
Yeah. I probably would be feel pretty comfortable doing that. 

You
I say. I mean, what, in your head right now, what motivate you to stop scrolling? I like to grow less. 

Daniel Kim
Um... Scroll 

You
Mm-hmm. 

Daniel Kim
less. 

You
Exactly. Uh-huh. 

Daniel Kim
I have no idea bro. Like genuinely, like probably like, I don't know. The thing that motivates me to scroll less is just like hanging out with 

You
I 

Daniel Kim
people, or like just doing something with mine, 

You
see. 

Daniel Kim
something else 

You
Mm-hmm. 

Daniel Kim
that's not swelling, you know? like, I don't 

You
Would 

Daniel Kim
know. 

You
you feel weird like uncomfortable if your friend commented on your screen time? 

Daniel Kim
Uh, I think it'd be funny. 

You
You 

Daniel Kim
For 

You
think it's 

Daniel Kim
sure. 

You
be funny? Pay 

Daniel Kim
Or like, or there'd be like peer pressure maybe to like not 

You
pressure. 

Daniel Kim
do like 

You
Love that. 

Daniel Kim
too much 

You
He 

Daniel Kim
screen time, you know? So it's like, 

You
shares it with his close friends, but it's still motivated. Huh? 

Daniel Kim
I feel like that'd definitely be interesting though. 

You
Did he share it with his close friends? And we all get ice cream times, but it's still motivated to have. Oh, um, well, there's a question being posed by the committee that, um, if you shared screen time with your friends, and then your friends have high screen time, and you see that, would it motivate you to have less screen time? Oh, 

Daniel Kim
Um... 

You
you just feel like you're gonna spend that high screen time with them, too. 

Daniel Kim
Well, I would I would probably make fun of them for having high screen time. And then 

You
Oh. 

Daniel Kim
like, maybe like, maybe like myself, I'd also have ice cream time, but like, I don't know. I'd probably like want it to be low right now. Like, you'd want a lower number or 

You
I 

Daniel Kim
whatever. 

You
see. Okay. Yeah. Okay, I think that's all we have to ask for you for these things. So, yeah, thank you, 

Daniel Kim
Wonderful. 

You
sweetie. Okay, 

Daniel Kim
Thank you, Thai. 

You
thank you. Good luck with whatever you're doing. Okay. Bye, yeah. 

Daniel Kim
Bye.
