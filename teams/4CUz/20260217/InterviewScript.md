Mindless Scrolling Prevention/replacement?

* Make educational summary/less stressful content format (simple quiz, summary slides,...)  
* Scan homework/ task \+ Tell us what you need to finish/accomplish  
  * Scroll after completing a task (rescan/ use AI to determine whether or not u actually did it)  
    * Or you have to send it to someone to verify u did it (embarrassment when you dont actually do it)  
* Educational scrolling reel types (all reels that teach you something?)  
* Do they scroll more at home / in different environments? (what is this?)  
* Add widget to share screen time with friends

Research Question:
