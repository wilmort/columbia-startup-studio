**Who Did You Talk To?**

| Name / Description | Gabriel, History, Scholar, Teacher’s College |
| :---- | :---- |
| How you found them | Walked up to him on the Columbia campus Joe’s Coffee |

**What Did You Learn?**

| Problem confirmed? Did they describe the problem unprompted? (Y / N) | Not unprompted. Mentioned around 3 hours of usage a day.  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Key quote** The single most revealing thing they said — use their exact words | “It doesn’t feel like a lot because it’s on my own time”. “Unless it's at school or at work, then one hour when I need to do something else feels like a lot”. |
| **Emotional intensity** 1–10. What did you observe? (cursing, sighing, detailed rants \= high) | 7\. Very detailed answers, very vocal about how he feels and why he opens apps and why. A big motivation is the connection aspect, can find people / conferences, but also scrolls for entertainment. |
| **Current solution** What are they doing now to deal with this? | Not much, once a week will put his phone to the side to stop scrolling. |
| **Money spent?**	 Have they paid for anything related? How much? | No. |
| **Surprise** What surprised you or contradicted your assumptions? | We thought high screen time would affect homework and deadlines, but it affected sleep the most. |

**Solution Reaction**

| Their reaction What did they say/do when you described the solution? | Tried a similar solution where an app stops instagram usage, but self-imposed limits so just deleted the app (a delay could be the same).  Interested in the leaderboard idea. Would use it to check on friends. Maybe reduce screen time due to the shame factor. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Key quote** Their most honest reaction — exact words | “I would know the password, so it just wouldn’t work”.  “I would check on it a bunch just to bag on my friends”. |
| **Biggest concern** What worried them or made them hesitate? | Concerned that a delay would likely result in the same outcome of deleting the app / removing the limit. Initially he hesitated on sharing personal data, but it was worth it to see his friend's data. |

**Commitment**

| Referral? Did they offer to connect you with others? (Y / N) Names: \_\_\_ | N |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Follow-up?** Would they do a follow-up conversation? (Y / N) | N/A |
| **Pre-purchase?** Would they pay now? (Y / N) | N |

🟢 GREEN — Strong signal. They have this problem, it's painful, they're spending time/money on it. Move forward.

**Commitment**  
What’s the single most important thing you learned from this interview?

Screen time does not feel like a productivity problem, but more like a self control and emotional problem. It’s only a problem when it affects sleep or when he's supposed to be doing work. He likes the leaderboard the most because of its accountability and he would enjoy making fun of his friends.

# Matthew

Interviewer: Elizabeth Lu   
Date: 2/15/2026   
Interview \#: 2 of 10

**Who Did You Talk To?**

| Name / Description | Matthew, Freshman, maybe Computer Science |
| :---- | :---- |
| How you found them | Sitting in Uris Hall (saw on social media) |

**What Did You Learn?**

| Problem confirmed? Did they describe the problem unprompted? (Y / N) | Not unprompted but definitely acknowledged the issue, didn’t want to share actual screentime, but said definitely too much screentime. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Key quote** The single most revealing thing they said — use their exact words | (When asked on usage) “Before I go to sleep, and sometimes when I’m procrastinating on my homework” |
| **Emotional intensity** 1–10. What did you observe? (cursing, sighing, detailed rants \= high) | 8\. Seemed invested since it was an issue he actively faces. Tried some solutions beforehand. |
| **Current solution** What are they doing now to deal with this? | Tried products like screentime or apps to attempt to fix this issue. One app he downloaded had a paywall and he deleted it because he wasn’t willing to spend money. |
| **Money spent?**	 Have they paid for anything related? How much? | None, but downloaded apps before. |
| **Surprise** What surprised you or contradicted your assumptions? | The willingness that he wanted to fix the issue but didn’t want to spend money and ultimately stopped trying to fix the issue. |

**Solution Reaction**

| Their reaction What did they say/do when you described the solution? | Educative scrolling feels less unproductive, but the range of content is anything from history to current news, etc.  Even a delay to opening instagram can be too abrasive (maybe resulting in the user deleting the app out of frustration). Likes the leaderboard idea, willing to share personal data to see friend’s data. He wouldn’t use another device like a laptop to scroll instagram (too shameful). |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Key quote** Their most honest reaction — exact words | “If I saw a leetcode I would scroll” “You’re the one who is creating that block and the one who can take down that block” (when asked if a leaderboard would reduce screentime) “I think it would, there's like a shame factor but it depends if you are sharing with your close friends” |
| **Biggest concern** What worried them or made them hesitate? | Technical concepts too different compared to funny/interesting reels would scroll A delay is still a self-imposed limit and can be easily removed by the user. If the circle of sharing data is with very close friends, might not actually induce enough shame to use less screentime. |

**Commitment**

| Referral? Did they offer to connect you with others? (Y / N) Names: \_\_\_ | N |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Follow-up?** Would they do a follow-up conversation? (Y / N) | N/A |
| **Pre-purchase?** Would they pay now? (Y / N) | N |

🟢 GREEN — Strong signal. They have this problem, it's painful, they're spending time/money on it. Move forward.

**Commitment**  
What’s the single most important thing you learned from this interview?

Reinforces the idea that self-imposed limits are not very useful and even the initial creation can be limiting (especially if the app is a paid subscription). The social aspect of the leaderboard solution is the most appealing part, but when shared with “too close” friends, the accountability aspect might not work as well.

# Hannah

Interviewer: Elizabeth Lu   
Date: 2/15/2026   
Interview \#: 3 of 10

**Who Did You Talk To?**

| Name / Description | Hannah, Sophomore, Econ Major |
| :---- | :---- |
| How you found them | Sitting in Butler Library Lounge (saw them on social media) |

**What Did You Learn?**

| Problem confirmed? Did they describe the problem unprompted? (Y / N) | Yes. Mentioned the usage of social media and was quick to mention they deleted TikTok because of the problem. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Key quote** The single most revealing thing they said — use their exact words | (when asked what are your most used apps) “So I deleted TikTok, and then Instagram. The reason why I use instagram is for dance”. |
| **Emotional intensity** 1–10. What did you observe? (cursing, sighing, detailed rants \= high) | 6\. Not very emotional about it but enthusiastic to talk about social media usage. |
| **Current solution** What are they doing now to deal with this? | Deleted the app.  |
| **Money spent?**	 Have they paid for anything related? How much? | None. |
| **Surprise** What surprised you or contradicted your assumptions? | After deleting TikTok, she only spends around 2 hours per day. Instagram is harder to delete due to more personal connections. |

**Solution Reaction**

| Their reaction What did they say/do when you described the solution? | Did not like the education content at all She initially liked the idea of having to wait before opening the app, but would probably bypass it if she really wanted to see a post or something. Somewhat interested, maybe a streak function with monetary reward could be helpful |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Key quote** Their most honest reaction — exact words | “Would have to be one of those things where you can’t bypass it”. “A lot of people in my circle would have similar habits” |
| **Biggest concern** What worried them or made them hesitate? | Bypassing the wait. Wouldn’t have an incentive to reduce screentime if all her close friends were the same. |

**Commitment**

| Referral? Did they offer to connect you with others? (Y / N) Names: \_\_\_ | N |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Follow-up?** Would they do a follow-up conversation? (Y / N) | N/A |
| **Pre-purchase?** Would they pay now? (Y / N) | N |

🟡 YELLOW — Mixed signal. Problem exists but urgency is unclear, or they're politely positive. Need more data.

**Commitment**  
What’s the single most important thing you learned from this interview?

The social aspect of the leaderboard can be both a positive and negative for people to continue using an app. We also have to compete with outright deleting the apps (although for more personal apps this is a lot harder to do).

# Andy

Interviewer: Luke Liang   
Date: 2/15/2026   
Interview \#: 4 of 10

**Who Did You Talk To?**

| Name / Description | Andy |
| :---- | :---- |
| How you found them | Sitting in Butler Library Lounge |

**What Did You Learn?**

| Problem confirmed? Did they describe the problem unprompted? (Y / N) | No, but acknowledged this was an issue he faces sometimes with around 3 hours of screentime a day (1-2 YT & 1-2 Instagram). |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Key quote** The single most revealing thing they said — use their exact words | (when asked what parts of social media appeal to them) “It’s just images, its very clear, its easy to direct your attention” |
| **Emotional intensity** 1–10. What did you observe? (cursing, sighing, detailed rants \= high) | 5\. Not very enthusiastic but still gave a lot of insights from a creator / designer perspective. |
| **Current solution** What are they doing now to deal with this? | Nothing |
| **Money spent?**	 Have they paid for anything related? How much? | No. |
| **Surprise** What surprised you or contradicted your assumptions? | Emphasized a lot of the interest factor, if it’s interesting then it can grab people’s attention etc. |

**Solution Reaction**

| Their reaction What did they say/do when you described the solution? | Open to it but emphasizes the design aspect (if the transitions are too abrasive or the content isn’t interesting, then it will not work).  Doesn’t see the delay being helpful at all Says it could work if you frame it as lets get better together |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Key quote** Their most honest reaction — exact words | “Why would I want to different types of feeds” “I feel like people wouldn’t really want to use that because there is shame associated with screentime” |
| **Biggest concern** What worried them or made them hesitate? | He wouldn't want to actively search for educational content, still a waste of time if it is too broad, and want to be clear with goals. Too much shame is also bad. |

**Commitment**

| Referral? Did they offer to connect you with others? (Y / N) Names: \_\_\_ | N |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Follow-up?** Would they do a follow-up conversation? (Y / N) | No but connected through instagram (likely because he also wants to work on a startup) |
| **Pre-purchase?** Would they pay now? (Y / N) | N |

🟡 YELLOW — Mixed signal. Problem exists but urgency is unclear, or they're politely positive. Need more data.

**Commitment**  
What’s the single most important thing you learned from this interview?

A little shame can help reduce screentime usage but too much shame and people will avoid entering the leaderboard all together. It will also depend a lot on execution and if you can generate interest and keep things interesting.

| How you found them | Sitting in Butler Library Lounge. |

**What Did You Learn?**

| :---- | :---- |
| **Key quote** The single most revealing thing they said — use their exact words | “I feel like I spend too much time on TikTok”. |

| **Surprise** What surprised you or contradicted your assumptions? | Had the most screentime out of the people we interviewed (upwards of 7 hours a day) but hadn’t tried any time reduction methods, but “open” to it. |

**Solution Reaction**

| Their reaction What did they say/do when you described the solution? | Seems open to educational content and already has a feed where some are funny but others are informative about new AI trends. Not very interested in this idea. The idea is good but he wouldn’t personally share his data with his friends. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Key quote** Their most honest reaction — exact words | “It’s very segmented” “I think it wouldn’t work from my perspective. People would just delete it” “Maybe share only the top 3 apps” |
| **Biggest concern** What worried them or made them hesitate? | Even if you spend less time on social media, if you spend the time unproductively like on games or watching TV, you’re still wasting your time. People would just delete the self-imposed delays Values privacy, especially on apps that  |

You start scrolling, you lose the work you’re doing” “First trigger is, of course, that you’re exhausted, you need a break, and you need that dopamine hit…number 2 is that you can’t stop it because you’re getting that trigger evertime you scroll.

| :---- | :---- |
| **Key quote** Their most honest reaction — exact words | “I’ll use it for 2 days, of course, I’ll have that motivation that I need to do this.

He was ok with the app with the content that matters to them to replace fun content on Tiktok.  He was neutral about the preventing scrolling app idea by showing homework progress.
