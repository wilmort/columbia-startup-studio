# User Interview Guide — DoneList + Plan vs Actual

---

## 🎯 Goal of the Interview

The goal is to understand:

- Whether users genuinely experience the “Where did my time go?” problem  
- How they currently plan and track their time  
- How painful the gap between plan and reality actually is  
- Whether they would realistically log daily activity  

⚠️ Focus on **real behavior**, not hypothetical opinions.

# 🧭 Interview Flow

---

## Part 1 — Background & Context (5 minutes)

Start casually and understand the participant’s daily life.

### Suggested Questions

- What do you currently do? (student / researcher / working / freelance)
- What does a typical weekday look like for you?
- How do you usually manage your time or tasks?
  - Calendar?
  - To-do list?
  - Notion?
  - Nothing structured?

🎯 Goal: Identify whether the participant fits the target profile — busy knowledge workers with multiple responsibilities.

---

## Part 2 — Real Behavior (Most Important) (10–15 minutes)

Anchor all questions to **recent, specific events**.  
Avoid vague “usually” answers.

---

### 1️⃣ Walk Through Yesterday

Ask:

> “Can you walk me through what you did yesterday from morning to night?”

Observe:

- Do they recall clearly?
- Or do they hesitate and struggle to reconstruct their day?

💡 Difficulty recalling indicates strong opportunity.

---

### 2️⃣ The “Busy but Unproductive” Moment

Ask:

> “When was the last time you felt busy all day but didn’t accomplish much? What happened?”

Listen for emotional signals:

- Frustration  
- Guilt  
- Stress  
- Confusion  

🔥 Emotional intensity = meaningful product opportunity.

---

### 3️⃣ Weekly Reflection Behavior

Ask:

> “When you need to summarize your week — for a report or update — how do you remember what you actually did?”

Common responses:

- Checking messages  
- Scanning email  
- Browsing history  
- Guessing  

🔍 Reveals friction in retrospective visibility.

---

### 4️⃣ Past Time-Tracking Attempts

Ask:

> “Have you ever tried time tracking or logging your day before?”

If yes, follow up:

- What tool did you use?
- Why did you start?
- Why did you stop?

Typical reasons for stopping:

- Too much effort  
- Easy to forget  
- Too detailed  
- Felt like clocking into work  

🎯 These directly inform product simplicity and UX constraints.

---

## Part 3 — Plan vs Actual Gap (10 minutes)

Validates the core idea.

---

### 5️⃣ Do You Usually Make Daily or Weekly Plans?

If yes, continue.

---

### 6️⃣ Describe the Last Plan That Didn’t Go as Expected

Follow-up:

- How long did you expect it to take?
- How long did it actually take?
- What caused the difference?

Look for patterns:

- Underestimation  
- Distractions  
- Interruptions  
- Context switching  
- Energy fluctuations  

📊 These map directly to the “Plan vs Actual” feature.

---

### 7️⃣ Do You Currently Analyze Why Your Plans Fail?

Most participants will say no.

Then gently test:

> “If a tool automatically showed where time drift happened, would that be useful?”

Pay attention to tone and enthusiasm.

---

## Part 4 — Light Concept Test (5–8 minutes)

Avoid pitching features. Focus on outcomes.

Present neutrally:

> “Imagine there’s an app that:
> - Quickly logs what you actually did  
> - Shows a simple visual timeline of real activities  
> - Compares planned schedule with what actually happened  
> - Highlights where time drift occurs  
>
> How useful would something like that be for you? Why?”

Distinguish polite curiosity from genuine need.

---

### 🧪 The Disappearance Test

Ask:

> “If you used this for a month and it suddenly disappeared, would you miss it? Why or why not?”

Reveals true value perception.

---

### 💰 Light Pricing Check

Ask:

> “Would you pay $3–5 per month for something like this?”

Purpose: Test seriousness, not sell.

---

## Part 5 — Habit & Friction (Critical Section)

Logging behavior determines survival.

Ask:

> “How much time would you realistically spend logging your day?”

Options:
- 10 seconds  
- 1 minute  
- 5 minutes  

⛔ This sets a hard UX boundary.

Then ask:

> “Which sounds better?”

A. Fully manual logging  
B. Fully automatic tracking  
C. Semi-automatic suggestions you confirm  

🧠 Responses shape automation strategy.

# 🚨 Important Reminders

Avoid asking:

- “Would you use this?”
- “Do you like this idea?”

Instead ask:

- “When was the last time?”
- “What actually happened?”
- “Why did you stop?”

Observed behavior > Stated preference.
