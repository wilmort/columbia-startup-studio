a: How do you organize your day?
b: Mostly with Apple Calendar and Reminders. I schedule classes, meetings, and deadlines there, and I put tasks into Reminders.
a: So you don’t use paper?
b: Sometimes I still jot things down in a notebook, but mainly it’s digital. Calendar for time blocks, Reminders for tasks.
a: Does that system work well for you?
b: It works to a certain extent. I can see what’s scheduled, and I get notifications. But sometimes I forget to prioritize things properly. Everything just sits in the list, and that’s actually pretty frustrating.
a: What do you mean by that?
b: Like, I’ll have a bunch of tasks in Reminders, but they all look the same. I don’t always know what I should focus on first. I end up switching between tasks or starting the wrong thing.
a: So it’s more of a prioritization issue?
b: Yeah, definitely. And sometimes I overestimate how much I can do in one day. My calendar looks organized, but in reality, it doesn’t reflect how my time actually goes. That gap stresses me out.
a: Have you tried other systems?
b: I’ve experimented with journaling and different to-do setups. A mix of planner plus task list feels better, but it’s still manual and doesn’t really solve the priority problem.
a: If there were a tool that combined structured scheduling with clearer priorities, would that help?
b: Honestly, yes. If something could clearly tell me what matters most today and adjust based on my workload, that would make a big difference.
a: Would you test a simple prototype that helps surface priorities automatically?
b: Yes, I would. Especially if it integrates with Apple Calendar and Reminders. If it actually solves this prioritization issue, I’d definitely keep using it.
