Background & Context
Currently unemployed; not actively a student looking for a job.

Typical day:
Wake up
Check emails
Lounge around
Do a little work
Go to bed

Currently has few tasks, so does not use a to-do list much.
Previously used Todoist when there were more responsibilities.

Actual Behavior

Since not employed, daily activities often feel unstructured and not worth remembering.
Mostly “meaningless tasks,” unless important interviews are scheduled.

“I was busy all day but didn’t accomplish much”? — mainly during exam season.

No strong desire to look back on daily logs.
Might find value in reviewing notable events over the past month.
Feels memory is good enough for recalling the past week.

Uses Instagram Stories to post important moments.
Still using it.
But feels “nothing is happening” lately.

Planning & Execution Gap

Does not usually create daily plans.
Only plans when there are time-sensitive tasks.
Otherwise relies on mental recall instead of written tracking.

Light Solution Testing / Product Feedback

Interest Level

Would consider a tool if phone activity is logged automatically.
Minimal manual effort required.

Does not care about logging mundane days.
Only interested in weekly or monthly special events.

Believes 80% of weekly schedule is repetitive for most people, so tracking everything feels unnecessary.

Would not pay for a daily logging app.

Instagram Comparison

Instagram currently used for social sharing and important life moments.
Problem: hard to recall past events; requires scrolling through archive.

Even if a new tool is more organized and visual, would still use Instagram for social features.
Would not fully switch away from Instagram.

If integrated with photos, might use as a secondary memory map.
