·  	I interview my sister Lin
·  	She has worked on multiple startups already and is worth several million at age 21
·  	I run the idea by her and she says the idea is “cute” and that “people love journaling”
·  	I ask her how she keeps schedule of her day and what she’s done and she said it’s not really a problem because her day is so repetitive
·  	I tell her that she’d need to manually insert photos and she said that felt like a chore and wouldn’t want to do that
·  	I ask her if she’d pay any more for this app and she said the UI has to be impeccable and even then she needs to see the actual app to consider paying it but that “probably not”
·  	She tells me that journaling is fun but isn’t something she does daily
·  	She likes the idea of seeing what you did each day but would only like if it was automatic or nearly automatic without any input
·  	She said better ideas are probably out there and theres too many similar apps to this already but if we can do it better than everyone else then “maybe”
·  	Overall wasn’t very enthusiastic
·  	Doesn’t consider scheduling or journaling as major daily problems
·  	Says she uses notes or other apps for scheduling but not too often or even just normal agenda notebooks
·  	Currently looking for her next venture so scheduling more frequent then usual for networking but once she is in a schedule its repetitive
