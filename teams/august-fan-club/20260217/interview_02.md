·  	I interview my friend Madison Hardin on facetime
·  	She is my friend from undergrad, probably my best friend so she might give biased feedback but I ‘ve never known her to not be brutally honest with me
·  	I tell her the context of my interview and let her know its for this startup class and give her all the context
·  	I also preface that I’m not super on board with the idea myself which may not have been a great idea because it may have affected her answers
·  	I ask her how she generally feels about scheduling and journaling and she tells me its not really a consideration for her at all
·  	I ask her if it solves any sort of problem for her and she tells me no, but I also need to consider she isn’t my pefect user
·  	She stays at home, is unemployed, and has wealthy families and journaling and scheduling isn’t too relevant for her
·  	I ask her if she’s ever tried anything similar and she said she just uses her notes app if she needs a reminder for anything
·  	She tells me that this idea is bland and there could be much more innovative ideas out there
·  	She also said there are a million of copies of apps like this already
·  	She gets distracted and starts talking about her love life which indicates she isn’t interested in this idea
·  	I ask her if I can follow up if we change ideas and she is open to it
