Background & Context
A student researcher. A typical weekday is either mostly researching experimental physics, taking data and analyzing data. Some days at the lab are pretty long. Some days chilling at home looking at papers. Manage time with a reminder app from Apple. 

Real Behavior
Use reminder app in this way: say what time should get something done by and get a reminder. Most often just write down and check it here and there. Turnaround time pretty fast on tasks so this is fine. 
Busy all day but don’t accomplish much? Mostly when experiments don’t go well. Most of the time when things don’t go well, it doesn’t feel that bad. Knows still getting something from it. 
Feel frustrated when things don’t work, but as long as figured out why it wasn’t working, it’s fine.
Feel the need to summarize day/week? Someone who tries best to remember things naturally. Cool idea, probably try out, but not something they would go out of their way to do.
Only do a bit of todo listing but no tracking. Doesn’t care if day deviated from “plan”, no real day plan to begin with, only overall todo list. 
Light Concept Test
Would try out the app. Could need this when things stack up, but won’t need this daily. Could use help for more urgent planning.
One use case is during experiments that they do, a lot of time is spent in the lab to get data, if things don’t go well and are behind progress, it could be useful to track how behind progress they are. But this is more on a weekly/monthly scale, like a project management timeline. 
I don't want to keep a scrapbook of everything done today. 
Payment intent really depends on feature, such as integration between people, team wide progress check.
