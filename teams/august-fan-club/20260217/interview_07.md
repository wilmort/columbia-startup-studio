> When was the last time you felt “I was busy all day but didn’t accomplish much”? What happened?

Sometimes felt did some works throughout the day but don’t know what actually happened

memory

Fitness scheduled for 1 hour but takes 2 hours and felt sleepy after taking shower

Yes

> Imagine there’s an app that:
>
> * quickly logs what you actually did during the day
> * shows a timeline of your real activities
> * compares your planned schedule vs what actually happened
> * highlights where time drift happens

> How useful would that be for you? Why?

It would be useful because sometimes would play phones for a long time without realizing it.

Yes, use other substitution

Ok with more functions

15 mins for a chunk of time but if record current events with in 30 seconds but with shortcut on desktop doesn’t matter
