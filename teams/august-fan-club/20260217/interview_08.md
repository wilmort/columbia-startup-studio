a: So how have things been lately?
b: Pretty busy. I have heavy coursework, plus job prep and personal stuff. It feels like there’s always something to do.
a: How do you usually manage your tasks?
b: I write physical memos. Sticky notes. I stick them on my monitor so I can see everything in front of me.
a: Do you use any digital tools?
b: Not consistently. I’ve tried some free apps before, but I never stick with them. When things get busy, I just go back to paper.
a: What happens when tasks pile up?
b: If I’m really busy, I write everything down. But on lighter days, I sometimes only write the most urgent thing and ignore the rest.
a: Do you review what you completed at the end of the day?
b: Not really. Once I finish, I just throw the note away.
a: How do you feel about your productivity overall?
b: Honestly, I never feel like I accomplish much, even when I’m busy all day.
a: Even when you’ve been working the whole time?
b: Yeah. I’m doing things, but I don’t feel a strong sense of completion. It just feels like I’m constantly behind.
a: If there were a lightweight tool that helps track small wins and visualize daily progress, would that help?
b: That could be helpful. But it has to be simple. I don’t want a complicated project-management tool.
a: What would stop you from using it?
b: Probably habit. I’ve tried apps before and stopped after a few days. If it takes too much effort, I won’t maintain it.
a: Would you test a simple prototype if it only takes a few minutes per day?
b: Yeah, I’d try it.
