# Interview Summary Profiles

---

## Respondent 1

### Current Setup
* Receives programming verbally from coach (Antoine)
* Follows instructions directly without a written program
* Rates workout clarity at 5/5

### Pain Points
* Feels the lifts place excessive stress on the lower back
* No real way to track maxes when velocity-based training is required
* Repetitive rep schemes (e.g., always 6 reps) feel limiting

### Percentage & Max Tracking
* Has never been unsure about what weight to use
* Never has to calculate weights from percentages
* Not sure what happens when maxes improve — suggests updates aren't relevant to current setup

### Desired Improvements
* Rated auto-adjusting programming as 1 (not important) — likely because current setup doesn't use percentages
* Implicitly wants better max tracking that accounts for velocity-based work
* Wants more variety or specificity in programming

### Overall Sentiment
* Generally satisfied with coach-led approach
* Frustration is more about program design (exercise selection, rep schemes) than delivery method
* Low urgency for tech-based solutions

## Respondent 2

### Current Setup
* Receives programming via a shared Google Sheet
* Rates workout clarity at 4/5

### Pain Points
* Has to calculate own weights from percentages
* Has been unsure about what weight to use due to outdated percentages
* Finds manual weight calculation to be the most frustrating part of the current setup

### Percentage & Max Tracking
* Calculates percentages independently when maxes improve
* Despite rating "Never" on frequency of calculation, explicitly calls it out as the top frustration — suggests it happens enough to be annoying

### Desired Improvements
* Rated auto-adjusting programming as 4 (important)
* Wants percentages to update automatically when maxes change
* Wants to remove the manual math from the workout experience

### Overall Sentiment
* Mostly satisfied with the Google Sheet format
* Clear, singular frustration: manual percentage calculation
* Strong candidate for auto-updating percentage-based tools

## Respondent 3

### Current Setup
* Receives programming via a shared Google Sheet
* Rates workout clarity at 3/5 — lowest of all respondents

### Pain Points
* Finds it unclear what they need to do in workouts
* Has been unsure about what weight to use due to outdated percentages
* Occasionally has to calculate own weights from percentages

### Percentage & Max Tracking
* Calculates percentages independently when maxes improve
* Experiences this issue occasionally rather than constantly

### Desired Improvements
* Rated auto-adjusting programming as 4 (important)
* Wants clearer workout instructions — not just weight calculation, but overall direction
* Needs better organization and communication of what to do each session

### Overall Sentiment
* Most confused of all respondents about day-to-day execution
* Frustration goes beyond percentages into general workout clarity
* Would benefit most from a structured, clear interface that spells out exactly what to do
