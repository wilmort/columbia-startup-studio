# Interview 02 – RC (Columbia Track & Field)

## Background

RC is a collegiate track athlete competing in events that require speed and power but also frequent racing throughout the season. Unlike sports with a single championship focus, track athletes often compete week after week, with different athletes racing at different meets.

For RC, strength training plays a supporting role. It matters, but it is clearly secondary to race performance. When she talks about her training calendar, competitions anchor everything. Strength work is something that needs to fit around that.

This context shapes her experience with the current system.

## Current Strength Programming Structure

RC’s strength programming is primarily coach-driven.

- The coach designs and tracks the lifts.
- Athletes execute what is written.
- Adjustments are occasionally made near competitions.
- Programming is often delivered in a team-based structure.

While the system is organized, it is not deeply individualized around race schedules.

This becomes important.

## Key Incident

RC described a specific situation that stood out.

Close to an important race, the coach introduced a new lift variation. It was not necessarily programmed irresponsibly — but it was unfamiliar and loaded differently than what athletes were used to.

The result:

- Athletes experienced unusual soreness.
- Legs felt heavier than expected.
- Performance at the race was impacted.

For RC, this wasn’t just about soreness. It highlighted something deeper:

Strength programming was not tightly synchronized with competition demands.

## Structural Issue: Competition-Aware Personalization

In track, not every athlete competes every weekend.

Some athletes:

- Race this week.
- Rest the next.
- Travel intermittently.

However, strength programming is often delivered in a group format.

This creates tension:

- Athlete A might be tapering for a meet.
- Athlete B might be in a heavy training week.
- Athlete C might not be racing at all.

Yet strength load adjustments are not always individualized to that level.

RC pointed out that while the coach sometimes modifies lifts near big competitions, there is no seamless system that:

- Automatically scales volume.
- Flags high fatigue risk.
- Adjusts load intensity based on race schedule.
- Differentiates athletes competing that week vs. not.

Everything depends on manual coach awareness.

## Pain Points

RC did not express frustration about logging or tracking.

The problem is not:
- Calculating percentages.
- Entering data.
- Viewing spreadsheets.

The core pain is timing and personalization.

She worries about:

- Lifting too heavy too close to competition.
- Introducing new movement patterns at the wrong time.
- Accumulated fatigue from strength interfering with race sharpness.

Her frustration is less about interface and more about load management strategy.

---

## Emotional Undercurrent

RC’s tone suggested something important:

Athletes trust the coach — but they don’t always understand the logic behind timing decisions.

When strength feels mistimed, they experience the consequences directly (fatigue, soreness, race performance).

However, they are unlikely to push back strongly.

Instead, they adapt:

- Mentally prepare for soreness.
- Reduce intensity slightly without saying much.
- Accept it as part of the process.

The issue is not rebellion.

It’s lack of dynamic responsiveness.

---

## Broader Pattern

Track athletes race throughout the year.

That means:

- Micro-tapers matter.
- Weekly fatigue modulation matters.
- Small load miscalculations can show up immediately in performance.

Yet most team-based strength systems are not competition-aware at an individual level.

They operate on:

- Shared calendars.
- Fixed cycles.
- Manual coach oversight.

This creates vulnerability.

## Key Insight

For RC, the problem is not tracking or automation of percentages.

It is adaptive load scaling.

She does not need:

- A prettier spreadsheet.
- More analytics.
- A social feed.

She needs:

- Competition-aware programming.
- Clear differentiation between racing and non-racing athletes.
- Automatic taper modulation when a race approaches.
- Avoidance of high-soreness novelty lifts before key competitions.

Her pain is strategic, not technical.

## Strategic Signal

This interview reveals an opportunity beyond logging:

Strength programming in team environments needs to:

- Recognize individual competition schedules.
- Scale load dynamically.
- Avoid mistimed stress.
- Maintain performance alignment.

The risk is not inefficiency.

The risk is mistimed fatigue affecting race outcomes.

If solved well, this kind of system would:

- Increase athlete trust.
- Improve performance consistency.
- Reduce avoidable race-day fatigue.

For athletes like RC, personalization and timing matter more than tracking depth.
