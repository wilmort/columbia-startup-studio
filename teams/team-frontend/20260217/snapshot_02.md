# Snapshot 02 – RC (Columbia Track & Field)

## Athlete Type
Competition-heavy athlete.
Strength supports racing.
Performance timing is critical.

## Current System
- Coach-managed strength programming.
- Group-based structure.
- Occasional manual adjustments near meets.
- No systematic competition-aware scaling.

## Core Friction
- New lifts introduced too close to races.
- Excess soreness before competition.
- Load not always individualized around race schedule.
- Heavy weeks not differentiated across athletes competing vs. not competing.

## Behavioral Adaptation
Rather than openly challenge the plan, athletes:

- Accept mistimed soreness.
- Quietly adjust intensity.
- Reduce loads slightly if needed.
- Mentally separate strength fatigue from racing goals.

This creates misalignment between intended programming and actual execution.

## Key Insight

The core issue is not logging.
It is adaptive load modulation.

Track athletes race frequently and at different times.
Strength programming must reflect:

- Individual competition calendars.
- Micro-taper cycles.
- Fatigue management.

Without competition-aware personalization, even well-designed strength programs can interfere with race performance.

## Strategic Opportunity

Build a system that:

- Knows who is racing and when.
- Automatically scales volume and intensity.
- Flags risky lift introductions near competition.
- Differentiates training load by athlete, not just team.

For athletes like RC, the value is not better tracking.

It is smarter timing.
