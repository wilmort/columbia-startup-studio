# Interview 01 – DT (Texas Rowing)

## Background

DT is a collegiate rower at Texas. For her, strength training clearly supports rowing, but it is not the central focus of her athletic identity. When describing her training week, she talks about rowing pieces, erg work, and water sessions first. Lifting is something that “comes with it,” not something she independently optimizes.

This framing heavily influences how she interacts with strength programming systems.

## Current Strength Programming System

The team uses a fully paper-based system.

- The lifting coach prints out physical paper programs for each athlete.
- Phones are not allowed in the weight room. They must stay in lockers.
- Each athlete writes in their lifted weights with a pencil directly on the printed sheet.
- At the end of the session, the paper goes back into a folder or locker.

There is no centralized digital record of what was lifted that day. If a paper gets lost, the data is gone.

DT mentioned that papers do occasionally get misplaced or thrown away. There is no systematic archiving of progression over months or seasons.

## Personal Tracking Behavior

Despite the paper system, DT does maintain a minimal personal tracking system.

She uses:

- A Garmin watch to track heart rate during lifts.
- The Notes app on her phone outside of team sessions.

The Garmin technically has the ability to log sets and reps. However, she does not use that feature. She described it as too cumbersome and not worth the effort mid-workout.

Instead, after workouts (or occasionally later that day), she opens her Notes app and manually logs:

- Exercise name
- Weight used

She likes the checklist feature in Notes because she can mark exercises as completed.

Her primary goal is simple:
> “I just want to see if I’m going up in weight over time.”

There is no percentage tracking, no max updates, no formal progression model.

It’s lightweight and manual — but good enough for her current level of engagement.

## Pain Points

The biggest structural weakness in her system is lack of data retention.

- Paper sheets do not preserve long-term history.
- There is no clean way to see multi-month progression.
- If she wants to know what she squatted three months ago, she likely cannot retrieve that easily.

She also acknowledged that while the Notes app works for her, it is very basic. There is:

- No structured graphing.
- No automatic PR detection.
- No visualization of progress trends.
- No integration with rowing workload.

However, she does not currently feel strong pain around this.

That’s important.

## Attitude Toward Strength Training

DT explicitly stated that lifting is not something she views as central to her sport.

For her:
- Rowing performance is primary.
- Strength training is supportive.

Because of that, her tolerance for friction is low — but her demand for sophistication is also low.

She does not want:
- Complex dashboards.
- Advanced analytics.
- Deep percentage systems.

She wants:
- Something fast.
- Something simple.
- Something that does not interrupt the workout.

She acknowledged, though, that if she were someone who changed weights frequently between sets or treated lifting as a major focus, the Notes app would not be sufficient.

This suggests that her system works because her engagement level is moderate — not because the system itself is optimal.

## Key Behavioral Insight

DT represents an athlete who prioritizes:

Low friction > Advanced tracking.

She has already adapted to:

- Paper-based logging.
- Manual note tracking.
- No long-term data visualization.

She does not complain loudly because she has normalized the inefficiency.

However, the system:

- Loses data.
- Prevents long-term strength trend analysis.
- Does not integrate with wearable data.
- Requires manual duplication (paper + Notes).

If friction increased further, she would likely disengage — not seek a more complex solution.

---

## Strategic Signal

For athletes like DT:

- The system must be extremely lightweight.
- Logging must require minimal taps.
- It must not interfere with team rules (e.g., no phones in weight room).
- It should preserve long-term data passively.

She is not asking for sophistication.

She is asking for simplicity that works reliably.

If built correctly, such a system would not need to “sell” itself to her — it would quietly replace the Notes app and eliminate paper loss without adding cognitive load.
