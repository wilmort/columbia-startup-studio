# Snapshot 01 – DT (Texas Rowing)

## Athlete Type
Low-to-moderate strength engagement.
Primary sport = rowing.
Strength = supportive, not central identity.

## Current System
- Paper-based team programming.
- Pencil logging.
- No centralized data storage.
- Supplements with Notes app for minimal progression tracking.
- Wears Garmin but does not use lifting features.

## Core Friction
- No preserved long-term data.
- Manual logging.
- Duplicate systems (paper + Notes).
- No integration with wearable metrics.

## Behavioral Adaptation
Rather than demand a better system, DT adapted:

- Accepts paper inefficiency.
- Keeps lightweight personal log.
- Prioritizes low friction over depth.
- Does not seek optimization tools.

## Key Insight

For athletes who view strength as secondary:

- Low friction matters more than advanced analytics.
- Overbuilt systems will be ignored.
- Manual but simple > powerful but cumbersome.

However, even for this athlete:

- Data retention is fragile.
- Progress visualization is minimal.
- There is no structured long-term strength history.

A seamless, ultra-lightweight system that preserves data automatically — without adding steps — would likely replace both paper and Notes quietly.

This athlete will not demand sophistication.

But she will adopt simplicity that works better than what she has now.
