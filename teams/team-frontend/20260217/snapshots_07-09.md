# Respondent Snapshots

---

## Respondent 1
Receives programming verbally from his coach and follows it without a written plan. Satisfied with the delivery method but frustrated by repetitive rep schemes and the inability to track maxes during velocity-based work. Low interest in auto-adjusting tech — his bottleneck is program design, not tooling.

## Respondent 2
Uses a shared Google Sheet and finds the workflow mostly clear. Single biggest frustration: having to manually calculate weights from percentages when maxes change. Wants an auto-updating system that removes the math. Strong fit for percentage-based automation.

## Respondent 3
Uses a shared Google Sheet but reports the lowest clarity of all respondents. Frustrated not just by percentage math but by a general lack of direction — unclear on what to do each session. Needs the most hand-holding: clear instructions, auto-calculated weights, and structured guidance all in one place.
