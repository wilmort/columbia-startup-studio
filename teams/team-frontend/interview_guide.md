# Strength Programming Interview Guide (Coaches)

---

## Intro (2–3 minutes)

Thanks for taking the time. I’m working on understanding how coaches currently manage strength programming for multiple athletes.

I’m not pitching anything — I just want to understand how you currently operate and where things are frustrating or inefficient.

There are no right or wrong answers — I’m interested in what you actually do.

---

## Section 1: Context & Background

- Can you tell me about the athletes you coach? (sport, level, age group)
- Roughly how many athletes are you programming for at once?
- How often are you updating their programs?
- Do you work independently or within a larger coaching staff?

---

## Section 2: Current Programming Workflow

- Walk me through how you currently create a strength program for an athlete.
- What tools do you use? (Google Sheets, TeamBuildr, TrainHeroic, Excel, Notion, etc.)
- How long does it take you to create a new program?
- How do you send it to the athlete?
- How do athletes report their results back to you?

---

## Section 3: Managing Multiple Athletes

- What gets harder when you’re programming for 10+ athletes instead of just one?
- Do you reuse templates or write everything from scratch?
- How do you individualize programs within a group?
- What happens when one athlete progresses faster than others?
- How do you keep track of who is on which phase or progression?

---

## Section 4: Handling Strength Updates (1RM / Rep Max)

- How do you determine an athlete’s working weights?
- How often do you test or estimate 1RM?
- If an athlete improves their max, what do you have to manually change?
- Does anything update automatically right now?
- Have you ever had programming errors because of outdated max numbers?
- How do you track progression over time?

---

## Section 5: Friction & Pain Points

- What part of programming is the most time-consuming?
- What part feels repetitive or tedious?
- Where do mistakes tend to happen?
- What’s the most frustrating part of managing multiple athletes?
- If you could eliminate one part of your workflow entirely, what would it be?

---

## Section 6: Athlete Communication

- How do athletes ask questions about their program?
- Do athletes ever misunderstand prescribed percentages or rep targets?
- How do you ensure they’re lifting the correct weights?
- How often do you have to clarify adjustments mid-week?

---

## Section 7: Existing Solutions

- Have you tried any dedicated strength programming platforms?
- What did you like about them?
- What didn’t work?
- Why did you stay or switch away?

---

## Section 8: Value & Priority

- How important is programming efficiency to you compared to athlete communication, recruiting, recovery tracking, etc.?
- If your programming workflow was 50% faster, what would that allow you to do?
- Have you ever paid for software specifically to solve this problem?
- What makes a tool worth paying for in your coaching workflow?

## Closing

- Is there anything about strength programming that I didn’t ask about but should have?
- Would you be open to giving feedback if we prototype something based on what you shared?
