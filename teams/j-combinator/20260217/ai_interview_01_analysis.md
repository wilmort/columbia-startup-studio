# Interview Analysis – Sunjana (02/13/26)

---

## 1. Target Fit Assessment

**Strong ICP match.**

- 6 years in NYC
- Marketing professional (digitally native, socially active)
- Highly social and activity-oriented
- Participates in structured hobbies (painting class, French class, book club)
- Actively shares and consumes recommendations
- Experiences FOMO and option overload

She is not disengaged from the city.
She is highly engaged but overwhelmed.

**Key Insight:** The product is not for people who “do nothing.”  
It’s for people who want to do everything — but can’t efficiently decide.

---

## 2. Behavioral Patterns

### A. How She Finds Things

She uses multiple platforms:

- Instagram ads
- Google search
- Eventbrite
- Resident Advisor
- Dice
- Partiful
- Google Maps pins
- Texting friends
- TikTok/Reels
- Word of mouth

She mentally categorizes platforms:

| Category | Platform |
|-----------|----------|
| Nightlife | RA / Dice |
| Academic / structured | Google |
| Social discovery | Instagram |
| Friends | Text / Reels |

She has built a manual system in her head.

**This is friction disguised as habit.**

---

## 3. Core Pain Points Identified

### 1️⃣ Platform Fragmentation

She explicitly wishes there were one unified app.

This validates strong demand for consolidation.

---

### 2️⃣ Expensive Long-Term Programs Lack Reviews

She struggles to find reviews for:

- Museum classes
- Multi-week programs
- Structured art experiences

Comparison:

| Category | Info Availability |
|----------|-------------------|
| Restaurants | High |
| Nightlife | Medium–High |
| ClassPass classes | High |
| Long art programs | Very Low |

**High cost + low information = high anxiety.**

This is a clear white space opportunity.

---

### 3️⃣ Option Overload / FOMO

She describes feeling overwhelmed by too many choices.

This is not a discovery problem.  
It is a decision fatigue problem.

Implication:

The solution should not show more options.  
It should narrow down to 3–5 highly relevant ones.

---

### 4️⃣ Cost Sensitivity

Even relatively small costs ($25 events) create hesitation.

Important nuance:

She is socially active but financially rational.

Positioning should feel:
- Efficient
- Smart
- Value-aware

Not “luxury” or “exclusive hype.”

---

## 4. Social Influence Dynamics

Extremely strong signal.

If she sees friends attending something repeatedly, she is far more likely to go.

Social proof reduces research time and decision effort.

This validates:

- Social graph signals
- "Friends went" indicators
- Lightweight activity feeds

The value is not just discovery.  
It is reducing cognitive load.

---

## 5. Documentation Behavior

She:

- Journals
- Uses Letterboxd
- Tried Beli
- Pins Google Maps
- Writes reflections
- Shares recommendations

She is open to logging experiences — but selectively.

Important tension:

Share vs. Protect.

She wants to recommend experiences but does not want them to become viral and lose quality.

Future consideration: privacy controls or semi-private sharing.

---

## 6. Emotional Themes

Observed patterns:

- Enjoys structure
- Enjoys intentional hobbies
- Values learning
- Likes shared experiences
- Feels overwhelmed by options
- Is cost-conscious

She is aspirational but planning-fatigued.

This strongly aligns with the defined target persona.

---

## 7. Opportunity Zones

### Highest Opportunity

Curated + socially validated discovery for structured experiences.

Especially:

- Multi-week classes
- Museum programs
- Skill-based activities
- Cultural events

Not ideal focus areas:

- Restaurants (too saturated)
- Movies (Letterboxd exists)
- Pure nightlife only (RA/Dice already strong)

White space = meaningful, structured, higher-commitment experiences.

---

## 8. What She Does NOT Struggle With

Important clarification:

- She does not struggle to find *something*.
- She is not bored.
- She is not socially isolated.

The positioning should not target loneliness.

It should target **noise reduction and decision efficiency.**

---

## 9. Strategic Implications

### Product Should:

- Reduce platform hopping
- Reduce decision fatigue
- Show trusted social signals
- Surface structured programs
- Limit option overload

### UI Should Likely:

- Present a limited number of curated picks
- Highlight "X friends went"
- Show cost transparency
- Indicate review density

### Features Validated:

- Social validation feed
- Lightweight rating system
- Program review layer
- "Friends bookmarked this" signal
- Cost-awareness tagging

---

## 10. Overall Signal Strength

This interview provides strong validation:

- Direct acknowledgment of fragmentation
- Emotional pain around overwhelm
- Clear gap in structured experience reviews
- Explicit desire for unified solution
- Strong social influence behavior

This is meaningful signal — not lukewarm feedback.
