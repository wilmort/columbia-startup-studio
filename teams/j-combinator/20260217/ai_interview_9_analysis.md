# Interview #9 Analysis -- Quant Researcher (Upper West Side)

## 1. Participant Profile

-   **Role:** Quantitative Research at J.P. Morgan\
-   **Location:** Upper West Side, NYC\
-   **Social Pattern:** Moderate -- brunch, gym, boyfriend, close
    friends\
-   **Discovery Style:** Low social media usage (deleted Instagram),
    heavy word-of-mouth + Google Maps\
-   **Personality Indicators:** Analytical, selective, skeptical of
    hype, "lurker" behavior

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Core Behavioral Patterns

### Discovery Sources

-   Word of mouth from trusted friends
-   "Taste-aligned" friends (not all friends are equal)
-   Google Maps browsing + pinning places
-   Minimal influencer reliance
-   Explicit skepticism toward paid content

Key Insight: \> Trust is weighted. Some friends have higher taste
authority.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Planning Friction

### 1. Long Planning Cycles

Example: Brunch took **1.5 months** to coordinate. - Multiple people -
Voting on 3 options - "One friend curates options" pattern

This reinforces: - Social planning = coordination tax - Curation role
naturally emerges in groups

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Activity Type Gap

She struggles with: - Non-food/non-drink activities - Especially in
winter - "What are we supposed to do?" problem

This is a **boredom gap**, not just discovery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Choice Friction (Shows)

She enjoys shows when she goes. But: - Hard to pick - Doesn't trust
mainstream taste - Doesn't always align with group preferences

This is a personalization problem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Trust & Influence Hierarchy

  Source                        Trust Level
  ----------------------------- ------------------------------
  Close, taste-aligned friend   High
  General friend                Medium
  Influencer                    Low (until friend validates)
  Platform reviews              Low unless extreme

Key Quote Pattern: She bookmarks influencer spots... But waits for
friend validation before going.

Implication: Social proof \> algorithmic ranking \> influencer hype.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Rating & Contribution Behavior

She only rates when: - Experience is extreme (very good or very bad) -
Emotional trigger present

She does NOT: - Rate average experiences - Engage casually

However: She would contribute if incentivized and if it improved
personalization.

This mirrors Interview #8 behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Strong Vertical Signal

When forced to choose categories, she picked:

1.  **Workout classes** (recurring, practical)
2.  Shows / concerts (one-off)
3.  Personal services (hair, nails)

Workout classes = strongest consistent signal.

Restaurants = saturated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Personalization Appetite

Reaction to AI learning system: Positive --- especially if: - Can input
hobbies (knitting, crafting) - Helps with winter boredom - Avoids
repetitive irrelevant recs

Major Deal Breaker: Poor early calibration.

If onboarding fails → churn risk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Behavioral Identity: "Lurker"

She explicitly identifies as: - Not a poster - Not highly interactive -
Skeptical of influencer culture - Passive consumer

This is important: Many NYC professionals behave like this.

Meaning: You cannot rely on heavy posting behavior. Passive signal
capture may matter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Emerging Pattern: Workout classes repeatedly surface as a viable anchor
vertical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Strategic Implications

### Strong Signals Across Interviews

1.  Social proof matters.
2.  Incentives may unlock participation.
3.  Workout classes are under-served relative to restaurants.
4.  One-off event timing matters.
5.  Early personalization must be strong.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. Risks Identified

-   Cold start calibration problem
-   Influencer-like dynamic repelling skeptics
-   Over-reliance on user-generated content from "lurkers"
-   Over-broad category surface area

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 12. Strategic Hypotheses

1.  Narrowing to workout + small-group experiences may increase urgency.
2.  Passive friend activity visibility may outperform explicit rating
    systems.
3.  Real-time discovery (especially winter) is emotionally relevant.
4.  Taste-weighted friend graphs may outperform generic friend feeds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 13. Summary

Interview #9 reinforces and sharpens earlier themes:

-   Social planning has friction.
-   Trust is selective and contextual.
-   Influencer culture is distrusted.
-   Incentives can increase contribution.
-   Workout classes are a recurring opportunity.
-   Winter boredom amplifies need.

This participant is rational, skeptical, and selective. Winning her
means: - Strong personalization - High trust - Low noise - Clear utility
beyond hype

Overall Signal: 🟢 Strong validation of opportunity --- especially
around workout-class vertical + personalized filtering.
