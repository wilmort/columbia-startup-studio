# Interview #8 Analysis -- Irene

## 1. Participant Profile

-   **Name:** Irene\
-   **Role:** Software Engineer at Netflix\
-   **Location:** New York City\
-   **Social Frequency:** \~3 times per week\
-   **Weekend Pattern:** Friends, events, restaurants, low-commitment
    social plans

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Core Behavioral Patterns

### Discovery Channels

-   Friends (primary source)
-   Instagram stories (passive discovery)
-   Word-of-mouth recommendations
-   Directly consulting "experts" in her friend group

### Social Structure Insight

She has: - A "restaurant friend" - A "concert friend"

This implies: - Micro-experts exist within friend groups. - Trust is
role-based, not platform-based.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Core Pain Points

### 1. Organic Social Discovery

> "It's kind of hard to meet new people in the city in a more natural,
> organic way."

She wants: - Low-commitment, small group events - Hobby exploration
without heavy social pressure - Casual discovery environments

This is less about *choosing events* and more about *expanding network
surface area*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Event Awareness Timing Problem

> "Sometimes you don't even realize there's some fun event going on
> until it passed."

This is significant.

She is not primarily frustrated by: - Too many options - Poor vibe
filtering

She is frustrated by: - Missing time-sensitive events - Ephemeral event
visibility

This suggests: - Notification timing matters - Real-time surfacing \>
static reviews

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Logging & Incentives Insight

Unlike Tiffany (Interview #7), Irene:

-   Would rate things **if incentivized**
-   Responds to:
    -   Points systems
    -   Exclusive access
    -   Tangible rewards
-   Prefers extremely low-friction input (star rating, like/dislike)

She does NOT want: - Long-form reviews - Frequent logging of everything

She would contribute if: - Easy - Rewarded - Improves personalization

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Desired App Features

If an app existed, she would want:

1.  Simple star/like input
2.  Clear feedback loop ("more input = better recommendations")
3.  Trending events section
4.  Personalized recommendations
5.  Friend feed layer
6.  Ability to follow taste leaders

Preferred discovery method: \> Combination of friend feed +
personalization

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Emotional Signals

-   Emotional intensity: \~6/10
-   Interest level: Moderate-to-High
-   Reaction to predictive app: "I think I would use it."

This is stronger than passive curiosity. Still not urgent, but shows
behavioral openness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Comparison to Interview #7 (Tiffany)

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Dimension                    Tiffany                 Irene
  ---------------------------- ----------------------- ------------------
  Main Friction                Coordination fatigue    Missing events

  Logging Desire               Low                     Incentive-driven

  Social Barrier               Familiar face lowers    Wants organic new
                               friction                connections

  Discovery                    Instagram + ClassPass   Instagram + friend
                                                       experts

  Interest in AI prediction    Curious                 Would use it
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Key difference: Tiffany = optimize existing network\
Irene = expand network + timing awareness

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Strategic Implications

### Strong Signals

-   Incentives can drive contribution
-   Friend micro-experts are real behavioral anchors
-   Real-time event surfacing may be more valuable than retrospective
    reviews
-   Low-friction UX is mandatory

### Potential Direction

Rather than "social Yelp," this may need to be:

-   A **real-time social signal layer**
-   With:
    -   Friend visibility
    -   Trending local events
    -   Time-sensitive nudges
    -   Simple feedback loops
    -   Optional gamification

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Hypotheses to Test

1.  Do users act more on "happening this week" vs. historical ratings?
2.  Will incentives meaningfully increase rating frequency?
3.  Is network expansion (meeting new people) more compelling than
    friend visibility?
4.  Is a small-group event vertical more compelling than broad
    discovery?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Summary

Irene validates a different but adjacent problem:

-   Organic social connection is hard.
-   Event timing visibility is weak.
-   Reviews only matter if they are easy and rewarded.
-   Combination of friend feed + personalization is preferred.

This interview strengthens the case for: - Real-time discovery -
Incentivized lightweight feedback - Social graph leverage - Small-group
event experimentation

Overall Signal: 🟢 Strong validation of opportunity, especially around
timing + incentives.
