# Interview #7 Analysis -- Tiffany (02/16/26)

## 1. Participant Profile

-   **Name:** Tiffany\
-   **Role:** UX Designer at a startup\
-   **Location:** Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn\
-   **Lifestyle Pattern:** Social + fitness-oriented, aesthetically
    aware, digitally native\
-   **Social Frequency:** 2--3 social activities per week\
-   **Primary Social Context:** Workouts (Pilates, run clubs,
    bouldering), brunch, neighborhood walks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Core Behavioral Patterns

### Discovery Channels

-   **Instagram** → primary discovery surface (friends reposting,
    aesthetic marketing)
-   **ClassPass** → booking/logistics layer
-   **Friends** → direct invites or indirect exposure via stories

### Decision Filter

-   Strong reliance on **social proof**
-   A "familiar face" significantly reduces friction
-   Vibe assessment is difficult pre-attendance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Problem Validation

### Confirmed Pain Points

1.  **Vibe Uncertainty**
    -   Instagram = aesthetic but potentially misleading
    -   ClassPass = logistical but emotionally neutral
    -   No tool that communicates "is this my kind of people?"
2.  **Coordination Fatigue**
    -   Quote: *"Coordinating schedules feels like solving a logistics
        problem every week."*
    -   NYC culture = busy, optimizing, ambitious
    -   Choosing the right event adds cognitive load
3.  **Social Barrier to Entry**
    -   Even weak-tie familiarity lowers resistance
    -   Social visibility increases likelihood of attendance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Emotional Signals

-   Emotional Intensity: **6/10**
-   Tone: Thoughtful, mildly frustrated but not angry
-   Frustration is recurring, not dramatic
-   Indicates **chronic friction**, not acute pain

This suggests the problem is real but not yet urgent enough to pay for a
standalone solution without strong differentiation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Current Workarounds

  Need           Current Tool        Gap
  -------------- ------------------- ---------------------------
  Discovery      Instagram           Aesthetic ≠ accurate vibe
  Booking        ClassPass           No social context
  Memory         Mental recall       No structured logging
  Social Proof   Stories / reposts   Passive & inconsistent

She does not formally log experiences, meaning documentation is not
currently a conscious need.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Market Insight Extracted

### Insight #1: Weak-Tie Effect

The "familiar face" insight is significant. Not necessarily close
friends --- even acquaintances reduce anxiety.

This implies: - Graph visibility \> rating system - Familiar network
layer \> anonymous reviews

### Insight #2: Fitness = Social Anchor

Her social life is fitness-centric. This may indicate: - A narrower
vertical (social fitness events) could be stronger than a broad
discovery app.

### Insight #3: Decision Fatigue \> Lack of Options

The issue is not scarcity. It is filtering and coordination overload.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Risk Signals

-   Reaction to solution: "Hmm. I'd be curious."
-   Interest: "Yeah sure I would be interested in it."

This is polite interest, not pull.

No: - Immediate "I need this" - No willingness to pay stated - No
expressed urgency

Signal: **Green but soft green**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Strategic Implications

### What This Interview Supports

-   Friend-layer discovery
-   Visibility of where friends are going
-   Social proof integrated into activity discovery

### What It Does NOT Validate Yet

-   Active logging behavior
-   Standalone rating system
-   High-intensity unmet pain

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Hypotheses to Test Next

1.  Does visibility of weak ties significantly increase attendance?
2.  Would users proactively open an app before planning?
3.  Is coordination friction solvable via asynchronous planning tools?
4.  Would narrowing to a vertical (fitness/social wellness) increase
    urgency?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Summary

Tiffany confirms the problem exists: - Social planning is cognitively
exhausting. - Vibe is hard to assess. - Social proof lowers friction. -
NYC amplifies coordination stress.

However, the intensity level suggests this is a *latent optimization
problem*, not yet a burning pain.

The opportunity likely lies in: - Reducing decision fatigue -
Highlighting trusted network activity - Narrowing scope to a specific
vertical before expanding

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Overall Signal:** 🟢 Positive validation, but requires sharper
positioning to create urgency.
