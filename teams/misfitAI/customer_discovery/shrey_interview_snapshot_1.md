## What Did You Learn?

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Problem confirmed?**              🟡 Partial --- Described friction
                                      but not strong pain

  **Key quote**                       "You never know what's in your
                                      wardrobe."

  **Emotional intensity**             4/10 --- Calm, reflective, no
                                      strong frustration

  **Current solution**                Browses websites (Googles items
                                      like "sleeveless tank top"); shops
                                      in-person (ZARA, H&M during first
                                      week of semester); tries on
                                      multiple items (4+); relies heavily
                                      on fit; color usually acceptable;
                                      mentally tracks wardrobe (no
                                      system)

  **Money spent?**                    No mention of overspending or
                                      financial frustration

  **Surprise**                        Loss of agency was a concern --- he
                                      didn't want AI fully deciding
                                      outfits for him

## Solution Reaction

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Their reaction**                  Interested in wardrobe visibility,
                                      but hesitant about AI making
                                      decisions

  **Key quote**                       "I wouldn't want to lose agency
                                      completely."

  **Biggest concern**                 Over-automation --- wants control
                                      over choices
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Commitments

  ------------------- -------------------------------------------
  **Referral?**       Yes --- offered to connect with roommates
  **Follow-up?**      Yes
  **Pre-purchase?**   No
  ------------------- -------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overall Signal

🟡 **YELLOW**

The problem exists (wardrobe visibility, coordination, fit friction),
but emotional intensity is low. Agency preservation is important for
product positioning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-Sentence Takeaway

Users may want wardrobe intelligence and suggestions, but not full
automation --- preserving agency is critical.
