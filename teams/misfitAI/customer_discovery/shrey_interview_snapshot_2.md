                                      variety and fit frustrations
                                      unprompted

  **Key quote**                       "I feel like I don't have enough
                                      variety."

                                      around fit and preparation time

  **Current solution**                Mix & match wardrobe; shops by
                                      season and need; compares model
                                      measurements to her own; waits for
                                      sales; window shops frequently;
                                      purchased pants Dec 2025

  **Money spent?**                    Actively purchases clothing (Mango,

                                      Outfitters); budget is a constraint

  **Surprise**                        Fit matters more than color; budget
                                      constraint strongly influences

                                      skeptical about onboarding effort

  **Key quote**                       "It would take a lot of time to
                                      take pictures of your clothes."

  **Biggest concern**                 Onboarding friction and whether
                                      items would realistically fit
                                      ("true to size")
