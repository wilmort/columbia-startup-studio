# Interview Raw Conversation Notes

- Very high energy. Immediately started talking about “running out of looks”
- Said she sometimes feels like she’s repeating outfits even if followers don’t notice
- I asked how she decides what to post? - Vibes + what’s trending + what hasn’t been worn in a while
- Uses Pinterest boards constantly. Also saves other creators’ outfits for inspo.
- Buys pieces specifically for videos, not always practical irl
- When I mentioned follower voting before posting, she seemed pretty interested
- Kept bringing up engagement
- Inventory tracking didn’t excite her much unless it helps content planning
- Planning content takes more mental energy than shooting it
- Concerned about integration like would this connect to Instagram or is it standalone
- I asked if she’d pay - If it increases engagement or saves planning time, yes
- Seemed to view this more as a creator tool than a closet organizer

Overall feeling: pain is creative fatigue, not lack of clothes.
