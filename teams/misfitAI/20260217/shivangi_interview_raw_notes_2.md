# Interview Raw Conversation Notes

- Opened with “I honestly don’t think about clothes that much”, said pretty casually
- Wears same 3,4 outfits on rotation for class, “default template”
- I asked how often she stands in front of her closet confused - only if it’s something important, otherwise grabs whatever’s clean
- Said presentations, networking events, dates stress her slightly because then she actually has to coordinate
- Relies on friends and mother for nicer events
- When I mentioned social voting, she immediately laughed that she doesn’t need feedback on her regular clothes
- Hates shopping in person, finds something that fits and reorders online repeatedly
- I askedmis she would use an app that suggests outfits - sure if it’s automatic, but not building a profile for 30 minutes
- Seemed more interested in remembering sizes/brands than creative styling
- Doesn’t want notifications
- Would try it if free, paying depends on how useful it feels

Overall doesn’t want fashion advice, wants friction removed.
