## What Did You Learn?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Problem confirmed?** | No, they didn't describe problem unprompted. When asked about fashion tendencies, they usually dress simple, with a rotation/switch between the same pairs of pants, jeans, sweaters, and/or jackets, simple black t-shirt on most days and a sweater/sweatshirt over. 

| **Key quote** | Gravitate towards some pieces of clothing over others. Dressing themselves highly depends on energy that morning, but a lot of statement pieces go unworn for weeks. Size is the most annoying thing for them to keep track of. Asks himself "Which would I feel most confident in that day?" Frustration to do with sizes being different in different brands.

| **Emotional intensity** | 4 - Not super passionate about the issue, but expressed some annoyance with the idea above based on sizing of clothes. 

| **Current solution** | Asks people for opinion texting in the morning for outfits. Has to go into store to try things on, prefers in-person shopping because of that. 

| **Money spent?** |No, they have not spent any money.

| **Surprise** | Doesn't look towards social media for fashion trends. Social media is too trend-forward. See things on people out and about on the street for ideas instead. Wouldn't care for it to be automated. It's not indecision, because you could pick the easiest outfit. But it's more a vibes based thing depending on how I am feeling that day.

## Solution Reaction

| | |
|---|---|
| **Their reaction** | Cool idea. He believes he is not the target demographic because he likes to do it himself.Discovering new clothes isn't the issue. Finding clothes to his specific body is the issue. A medium in one store won't fit a medium in another store. Loves the idea of a digital wardrobe. Forgets wardrobe when out shopping. For example, is this black the same black as the other shirt, is it more formal? Being able to see it on your body. And how many times have you worn it recently could be helpful. Having those statistics. 

| **Key quote** | Discovering new clothes or outfit pairings isn't the issue. Finding clothes to his specific body is the issue. 

| **Biggest concern** | He believes he is not the target demographic because he likes to do it himself

## Commitments

| | |
|---|---|
| **Referral?** | Yes, dads in home community. Offered to connect with parents, dads, because he believed it would be a product they would love. 
| **Follow-up?** | Yes, if the features more aligned with what he wanted and connected with stores he shopped at.
| **Pre-purchase?** | No, wouldn't pay for it because of how infrequent his use would be. If it was free, download and try it out. Feels like there is barrier to entry even if it was 99 cents.
