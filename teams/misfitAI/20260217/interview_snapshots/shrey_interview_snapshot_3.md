                                      student, practical dresser,
                                      routine-oriented

## What Did You Learn?

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Problem confirmed?**              🟡 Partial --- Described routine
                                      behavior but low pain

  **Key quote**                       "I have a default that I will go
                                      back to."

  **Emotional intensity**             3/10 --- Matter-of-fact, low
                                      frustration

  **Current solution**                Makes 30-second decisions when
                                      dressing; relies on default
                                      outfits; owns \~10 identical
                                      running shorts from Target;
                                      frequently wears the same cargos;
                                      mentally tracks what needs washing

  **Money spent?**                    Purchased multiple identical items
                                      (simplification strategy)

  **Surprise**                        He optimizes for simplicity and
                                      routine rather than variety or
                                      discovery

## Solution Reaction

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  **Their reaction**                  Skeptical about AI styling; prefers
                                      dressing to remain creative and fun

  **Key quote**                       "It would feel robotic to me...
                                      sometimes I like it to be a fun
                                      thing."

  **Biggest concern**                 Loss of agency and creativity
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Commitments

  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  **Referral?**       Yes --- suggested interviewing his roommate
  **Follow-up?**      Yes
  **Pre-purchase?**   No
  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overall Signal

🔴 **RED (Lean Yellow)**

Low emotional pain, already solved decision fatigue with defaults, and
resistant to automation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-Sentence Takeaway

Users who intentionally simplify their wardrobe through defaults may
resist AI styling because they value control and creativity over
optimization.

## Raw Notes
Alessandro
MSCS

When I’m brushing my teeth
I know what I’ve in my closet
I would like to wear what I’m wearing for multiple occasions
Sometimes outfit change for event

Has this happened recently?
30 sec decision in my brain
I have a default that I will go back to

Do you do something currently?
I have default clothes
~10 pairs of running shorts from Target – same
Sometimes I wear my cargos too much
Sometimes default pants

Remembering which clothes to wash

Personal stylist AI
It would feel robotic to me
On some times I like it to be a fun thing
Wants to have agency
Add creativity

Any other ppl to interview? N/a
