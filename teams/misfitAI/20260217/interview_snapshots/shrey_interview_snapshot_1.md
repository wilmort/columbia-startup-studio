                                      season and need; compares model
                                      measurements to her own; waits for
                                      sales; window shops frequently;

  **Their reaction**                  Interested in visualization;
                                      skeptical about onboarding effort

                                      take pictures of your clothes."

  **Biggest concern**                 Onboarding friction and whether
                                      items would realistically fit
                                      ("true to size")

## Raw Notes

Ishika Vasudeva user interview

Law school 2027

Put together - 1st year more often 3rd
How important your appearance, daily - dont care as much as first year, professional dress together. 2-3 chill events or at a chill bar, wear whatever to school hoodie crew neck

Nicer bar or clubs once or twice. bar review or a comedy show. Mostly it depends on my makeup night even black pants dark colored shirts or colored 

Problems -
Thinking not enough variety. Last Thursday and Friday i wore my oversized coat but i have been wanting a leather jacket.

Doing my hair is annoying thick curly hair routine over an hour straighten them also tooks over you.

Whenever i Purchase any pants regular and talls they always shrink. They fit perfectly at the beginning but not later. Fitting issues.

Online shopping?
Dec 2025 - i purchased pair of pants 

Window shopping?
1.5 hours ago - fitted button ups for the summer, shop by season? Based on what i need. Websites - mango, h&m, princess polly, urban outfitters. Fit & the color? Fitted shirts were very expensive pp and h&m its cheap for $35 more of that similar shirt was $19. Most important thing is fit. I compared myself to the model - measurements compare to herself. I am the standard body type for websites.

Budget is always a big constraint, if i see something i like i either wait for a sale or wait for a much cheaper option.

Wardrobe
Split into two - at home in seattle and one in madison (80% of the things). Outfit selection of current wardrobe - mix & match

Personal stylist AI

How many clothes will i take a picture of? It will take a lot of time to take pictures of your clothes

AI try to make it fit on me. True to size.

Wear it as it comes. Or will i be able to style button unbutton. 

1 feature that you would want to try the app for prob to see how clothing items would look on me

Magic wand  - describe a piece of clothing item what i saw someone wearing a really chunky cardigan 3 big flowers oversized balloon sleeves - pull up the website without the photo
