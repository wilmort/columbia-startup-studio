Participant: Chavi Mathur (SWE @ Bloomberg; friend).
​
Problem area: Accessory shopping confidence + matching to existing wardrobe.
​
“Sometimes I'm just wondering if the earrings will go with majority of my clothes.”
​

Warm-up: talked about shopping generally, then narrowed into accessories (earrings specifically came up).
​

When asked about buying accessories solo, she sighed and seemed mildly stressed/annoyed rather than excited.
​

She described the main uncertainty as: “Will this go with most of what I already own?” (earrings were the example).
​

She said she generally avoids shopping for accessories alone.
​

Current workaround is “shop with friends,” and she uses their reactions as the main input for whether to buy.
​

Painful outcome she mentioned: she sometimes discovers after buying that the accessories don’t actually match her clothes as well as she thought.
​

She is not currently spending money on a dedicated solution/tool for this.
​

I asked her to think of the last time this happened; she focused on the “earrings not matching as many outfits as expected” scenario.
​

The “moment of doubt” happens in-store while trying to decide quickly (she wants confidence without needing a friend there).
​

She implied the regret is not about the accessory quality, but about compatibility with her wardrobe and the missed chance to return/exchange later.
​

What she’s optimizing for
Independence: she explicitly wants a way to shop alone without needing friends present.
​

Time: she does not want a workflow that adds friction while shopping or requires lots of prep.
​

Cost: she does not want to spend money on this.
​

Reaction to proposed solution (clothes memory app)
When I described a “clothes memory” / wardrobe reference app that could show her wardrobe and help compare items while shopping, she reacted positively and said she’d love to try it.
​

She said: “I'm willing to try something that helps me shop alone.”
​

Biggest pushback: she doesn’t want to spend a lot of time digitizing her wardrobe.
​

Second pushback: she doesn’t want to pay for it.
​

Commitment / next steps
She agreed to a follow-up and is willing to try the first iteration of the app.
​

She offered referrals (names of friends she shops with).
​

She did not commit to a pre-purchase.
​

Open questions I’d ask next time

How often does she buy accessories (monthly/quarterly)?

What stores/brands does she shop at (online vs in-person)?

What’s the “too much digitizing” threshold (5 minutes? 30 minutes? ongoing maintenance)?

Would she accept a free version with ads, or “one-time scan” onboarding, or camera-only (no manual tagging)?

Returns: does mismatch lead to returns, or does she keep unused accessories (wasted spend)?
