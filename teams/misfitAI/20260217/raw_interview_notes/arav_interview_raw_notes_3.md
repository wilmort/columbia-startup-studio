# Interview Raw Conversation Notes

- Thoughtful and analytical tone throughout
- Confirmed the problem without prompting
- Framed the issue as a “daily struggle” but not overwhelming
- Appears fairly organized mentally, relies on memory
- Interested in the idea because he has thought about it himself
- Immediately qualified interest with price sensitivity
- Less emotionally charged than expected for a daily problem
- Focused more on cost-benefit than emotional relief
- Asked himself whether usage frequency would justify payment
- Did not reject the idea, but did not commit either
- Open to discussion but cautious

Overall feeling: real but moderate pain; value must be extremely clear to overcome hesitation.
