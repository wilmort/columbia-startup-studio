Participant: Aryaman Agrawal (Graduate Student @ Columbia Engineering; roommate).
​
Problem area: Not remembering what’s already in wardrobe → duplicate purchases / avoidance of shopping.
​
“I don't remember what clothes I have since I often reuse a few of them lol.”
​

He opened with a pretty blunt admission: he doesn’t remember what clothes he owns because he reuses a few items often.
​

When I asked about shopping habits, he seemed “weirded out” / uncomfortable by the topic (socially or personally not his thing).
​

Current solution is basically nothing—he avoids shopping altogether.
​

He gave the consequence: he has bought similar clothes because he didn’t remember what he already had.
​

He is not spending money on a tool/service to manage wardrobe.
​

Interpreting the avoidance (my impression)

It felt like shopping is a “cognitive overhead + mild embarrassment” task for him (not enjoyable browsing).

He likely wants to reduce decision-making, not increase it (simple, fast confirmation of what he already owns).

Reaction to proposed solution (wardrobe memory / digitized closet)
After hearing the idea, his reaction was positive (“He liked it.”).
​

He said (translated): “This is good. If made properly, I'd definitely use it.”
​

His immediate objection matched Chavi’s: he doesn’t want to spend time digitizing his wardrobe.
​

Commitment / next steps
He agreed to a follow-up and said he’d like to try the app.
​

He offered referrals and promised to connect the interviewer with friends who like shopping.
​

Pre-purchase: Yes
​

Clarifying questions to ask in follow-up
What does “pre-purchase” mean to him: pay now, or “I’d pay eventually”?

Price sensitivity: one-time fee vs subscription, and what range feels reasonable.

Onboarding tolerance: would he do a one-time 15–30 minute scan if it prevented future duplicate purchases?

Primary use case: shopping in-store vs online (checking closet before buying).

What “made properly” means: accuracy, speed, UI simplicity, privacy, offline support, etc.
