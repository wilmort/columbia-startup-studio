# Interview Raw Conversation Notes
- Main pain point was decision fatigue right from the start 
- “I’m already making decisions all day, don’t want another one”
- Wears mostly neutrals to reduce choices
- Doesn't enjoy styling outfits, it’s just something she has to "deal with”
- Admitted she sometimes changes outfits multiple times before leaving, then gets annoyed
- Special events stress her more because then she feels pressure to do better
- When I described multiple outfit suggestions, she said: “That’s worse, now I have more decisions” LOL
- Preferred idea of 1 strong recommendation, maybe 2 max.
- Concerned about setup, won’t do it if she has to upload every item
- I asked what would an ideal scenario look like - itt just tells me what to wear based on weather + what I’ve worn recently
- Not interested in social sharing at all
- Doesn’t shop often, replaces things when they wear out

Overall this is a cognitive load problem, not a fashion interest problem.
