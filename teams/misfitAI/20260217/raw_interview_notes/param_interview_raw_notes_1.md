# Interview Raw Conversation Notes

- Calm, low-energy conversation from the start
- Did not describe the problem unless directly asked
- Emphasized having very few clothes due to limited NYC room space
- Repeated that closet size naturally limits decision fatigue
- Views fewer options as a feature, not a constraint
- Already feels his system works fine for him
- No frustration or emotional charge when discussing clothing
- Did not attempt to optimize or improve the process
- When the solution was described, he immediately disengaged
- Clearly stated he does not see personal relevance
- No curiosity about future features or variations

Overall feeling: no pain, no urgency, and no motivation to change current behavior.
