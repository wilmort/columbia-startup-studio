## Idea 1

### Problem
Fit inconsistency across brands makes it hard to find “presentation-safe” clothing

### Solution
Scan available clothes and body and generate presentation-safe combinations

## Idea 2

### Problem
Limited tactile sense of fabrics. Unable to see, feel, or differentiate fabrics on devices. Missing fabric info leads to dumb suggestions (e.g., chiffon top in 30°F, sweaty polyester for an outdoor summer wedding).

### Solution
Fabric detection pipeline. App guesses fabric properties from the photo and brand info: likely fiber (cotton, wool, polyester), thickness, stretch, sheen, breath-ability. It outputs a fabric profile: “Lightweight woven, low stretch, medium warmth, breathable, slightly sheer.”

## Idea 3

### Problem
“Camera-ready ” tops are repetitive, and people feel judged for looking too casual or too overdressed

### Solution
Suggest accessory upgrades based on OOTD
