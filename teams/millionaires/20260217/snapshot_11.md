# Snapshot 11

**One-line profile:** Moderate user who watches political content, spots ragebait, but rarely acts on anything.

**Pain level:** 4/10

**Key behaviors:**
- ~1 hour/day; watches carefully when content is interesting
- Recognizes ragebait and fake news but finds it entertaining rather than alarming
- Occasionally Googles claims; checks comments sometimes
- Has seen fact-check labels but scrolls past them

**Attitude toward the tool:**
- Would use it specifically before sharing something
- Strongly prefers click-to-activate ("automatic would be annoying")
- Interested in creator credibility history
- Probably would not change sharing behavior despite saying he'd use it before sharing — weak signal

**Signal strength:** Low-moderate. Awareness is higher than most, but no consequences and the "probably not" on changing sharing behavior undercuts the use case. Interesting profile for a "check before I share" feature framing.

**Standout quote:** Would uninstall "if it was too in my face about it" — consistent with the broader pattern: users want passive, unobtrusive tools.
