# Snapshot 10

**One-line profile:** Bored scroller who shared misinformation about a campus event and experienced mild social embarrassment.

**Pain level:** 3/10

**Key behaviors:**
- Very frequent usage (bored = all the time)
- Watches memes, cooking, random content; shared a campus protest Reel
- Verifies via roommate or social environment, not independently
- Checks comments to see if others think something is true

**Attitude toward the tool:**
- Open to using it for local/campus news or sketchy claims
- Fine with either auto or click
- Wants simple warning-style interface
- Credibility indicator might change sharing behavior

**Signal strength:** Moderate. Has a real (if mild) consequence. Sharing campus/local content is an interesting niche where stakes are more immediate and social. The "verify via roommate" behavior suggests social proof matters more than institutional credibility for this user.

**Standout quote:** "I told my roommate the campus thing and she already knew it was fake, so that was a little embarrassing."
