# Snapshot 09

**One-line profile:** Heavy casual meme-only user with zero misinformation awareness or concern.

**Pain level:** 1/10

**Key behaviors:**
- High usage, exclusively memes
- Has not consciously noticed misinformation
- Ignores bold claims
- No verification behavior; not aware of Community Notes

**Attitude toward the tool:**
- Might use it if he actually cared about something
- Click-to-activate
- Wants whatever is easiest
- Credibility indicator would not change sharing behavior

**Signal strength:** Very weak. Purely entertainment consumption, no pain, no stakes.

**Standout quote:** "I don't need it fact-checking memes" — clear articulation of the mismatch between the product and his use case.
