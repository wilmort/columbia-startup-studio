# Snapshot 08

**One-line profile:** Frequent casual scroller who ignores bold claims entirely and has no awareness of existing verification tools.

**Pain level:** 2/10

**Key behaviors:**
- Daily use between classes; fast scroller
- Probably encountered misinformation but doesn't track it
- Ignores bold claims; no verification behavior
- Has never heard of Community Notes

**Attitude toward the tool:**
- "Honestly probably never" would use it
- Prefers click-to-activate (no more screen clutter)
- Doesn't understand the credibility feature categories
- Doesn't share Reels so credibility indicators are irrelevant

**Signal strength:** Very weak. Disengaged from informational content entirely. The lack of familiarity with even basic existing tools (Community Notes) suggests this user is far from the target profile.

**Standout quote:** Would uninstall "if it was annoying or slowed things down."
