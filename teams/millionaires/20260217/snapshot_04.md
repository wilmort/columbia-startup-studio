# Snapshot 04

**One-line profile:** Heavy meme scroller with near-zero concern about misinformation — relies on personal logic.

**Pain level:** 1/10

**Key behaviors:**
- 1–2 hours/day, scrolls 2–3 seconds per reel
- Almost never shares or saves informative content
- Uses intuition/logic to assess claims; doesn't verify externally
- Not aware of Community Notes

**Attitude toward the tool:**
- Mild hypothetical interest — only to distinguish entertainment vs. real information
- Prefers click-to-activate
- Would only want political warnings
- Credibility indicator would not change sharing behavior

**Signal strength:** Very weak. Lowest possible pain score, no consequences, no verification habits. Not a target user.

**Standout quote:** Would uninstall "if my friend made it" — suggests trust is social/personal, not institutional.
