# Interview Script – Instagram Reels Misinformation Study

## Section 1: Understanding Their Reel Habits
*Start broad and neutral.*

1. How often do you use Instagram Reels?
2. What types of Reels do you usually watch? (health, finance, politics, productivity, memes, etc.)
3. Do you usually scroll quickly, or do you watch certain videos more carefully?
4. Have you ever saved or shared a Reel because you thought it was informative?

**Purpose:** Identify heavy vs. casual users; informational vs. entertainment consumption.

## Section 2: Trust & Misinformation
*Move into credibility.*

5. Have you ever watched a Reel and later found out it was misleading or wrong?
6. How did you realize it was wrong?
7. Did that change how you felt about the creator?
8. When you see a bold claim (e.g., health advice, money advice), do you usually:
   - Trust it
   - Ignore it
   - Look it up elsewhere
   - Something else?

**Key insight:** You want to see if people already feel friction.

## Section 3: Current Behavior

9. If you're unsure about a claim in a Reel, what do you do?
10. Do you ever Google things from Reels?
11. Do you check comments for verification?
12. Have you ever seen Community Notes or fact-check labels on Instagram?

**This tells you:** Are they self-verifying? Do they rely on comments? Are existing tools visible or ignored?

## Section 4: Testing Your Idea (Without Leading)
*Ask behavior-based hypotheticals — avoid leading with "Would you use a fact-checking extension?"*

13. Imagine there was a small tool that could show sources behind claims in a Reel — when would you use it?
14. Would you want it to automatically pop up, or only when you click something?
15. Would you prefer:
    - Claim-level breakdown?
    - Creator credibility history?
    - A warning for high-risk topics (health/finance)?
16. Would seeing a credibility indicator change whether you share a Reel?

**Important:** Listen for hesitation. Polite "yeah maybe" = weak signal.

---

## Section 5: Pain Intensity

17. On a scale of 1–10, how big of a problem is misinformation on Reels for you?
18. Has misinformation ever caused you to:
    - Waste money?
    - Try something risky?
    - Share something embarrassing?
19. What would make you uninstall a tool like this?

**You want real consequences.** If there are no consequences, the product may not stick.

---

## Section 6: Specific Vertical Testing (Optional)
*If narrowing to a specific content vertical:*

20. Do you trust health advice on Reels?
21. Do you trust investing advice on Reels?
22. Have you ever followed advice from a Reel?

**You're testing which vertical hurts more.**
