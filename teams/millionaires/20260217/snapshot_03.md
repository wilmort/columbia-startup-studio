# Snapshot 03

**One-line profile:** Casual twice-a-week scroller who sees misinformation as a huge societal problem but doesn't want a tool to solve it.

**Pain level:** 9/10

**Key behaviors:**
- Scrolls quickly through memes and politics
- Verifies through friends and news
- Keeps scrolling past claims they're unsure about
- Aware of Community Notes

**Attitude toward the tool:**
- Hard no — skeptical the tool itself could be fake/biased
- Won't install without being "hooked" first; requires convincing
- Cites trust-building as a long process (referenced WSJ's 100-year credibility)
- Doesn't share informational content, only memes — low personal stake

**Signal strength:** Weak for adoption, but important segment. High awareness of the problem, zero intention to change behavior. Classic "I know it's bad but it doesn't affect me personally enough to act" user. Could be reached via social proof or platform-level integration rather than an install.

**Standout quote:** "I won't install it in the first place — I need to be hooked on it, I need convincing."
