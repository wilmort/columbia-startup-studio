**One-line profile:** Casual daily meme scroller who encounters misinformation and verifies via AI tools/news.

**Pain level:** 9/10

**Key behaviors:**
- Scrolls quickly; occasionally saves/shares informative content
- Verifies using AI tools and news when something seems off
- Googles claims and checks comments
- Aware of Community Notes

**Attitude toward the tool:**
- Open to it — would use for informational Reels from non-verified accounts
- Prefers click-to-activate, not automatic
- Strong concern about visual aesthetics; wants it passive/in the background

**Signal strength:** Moderate. High pain score but engagement is still primarily entertainment. Trust in a new tool would depend heavily on design quality and unobtrusiveness.

**Standout quote:** "Not having visual aesthetic" would cause uninstall.
