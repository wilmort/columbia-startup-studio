**Pain level:** 6/10

**Key behaviors:**
- Watches Reels carefully; saves/shares informative content
- Actively looks things up when uncertain
- Lost trust in a creator after encountering misinformation
- Not aware of Community Notes

**Attitude toward the tool:**
- Open — said yes to using a fact-checking extension and source tool
- Prefers click-to-activate
