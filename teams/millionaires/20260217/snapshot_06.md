# Snapshot 06

**One-line profile:** Passive social viewer who only watches Reels sent by friends; uses intuition to spot false claims.

**Pain level:** 1/10

**Key behaviors:**
- Watches Reels primarily when sent by friends, not active scroller
- Shares memes and occasionally breaking news
- Doesn't use Instagram for learning — low exposure to misinformation
- Not aware of Community Notes

**Attitude toward the tool:**
- Minimal interest — only for political content
- Prefers click-to-activate (automatic for political)
- Wants warnings specifically for intentionally misleading political content
- Credibility indicator would not change sharing behavior

**Signal strength:** Weak. Very low platform engagement and near-zero personal consequences. However, breaking news sharing behavior is a potential edge case worth noting.

**Standout quote:** "If it was easy to install and didn't take up storage, I wouldn't uninstall it" — low bar to keep, very high bar to get.
