## PROBLEM-SOLUTION PAIRS GENERATED

### DOMAIN 1: International Student Finance (10 Concepts)

#### 1. Currency-Aware Roommate Ledger
**Problem:** Roommates pay shared expenses in different currencies (USD, EUR, etc.), reconciling fairly over time is confusing and error-prone.

**Why this persona cares:** They're mentally taxed by school and finances; small currency mismatches feel unfair and create roommate tension.

**Solution concept:** A shared ledger that auto-converts expenses at time-of-payment exchange rates, tracks balances per person, suggests cleanest settlement payments.

**Pain likelihood:** 8/10 — Very real for international households, especially in grad-school cities.

---

#### 2. "Explain My Credit Card Like I'm New Here"
**Problem:** US credit card rewards systems (points, categories, statement credits, rotating bonuses) are opaque and overwhelming.

**Why this persona cares:** They're leaving money on the table—or worse, making suboptimal choices—because they don't understand how rewards actually work.

**Solution concept:** A rewards explainer that analyzes your card(s) and spending, then explains in plain English: "If you use this card for groceries this month, you get ~$18 back."

**Pain likelihood:** 9/10 — Extremely common and emotionally frustrating.

---

#### 3. Stipend Survival Forecast
**Problem:** Students on stipends don't know if they're "doing okay" financially month to month because income is fixed but expenses fluctuate.

**Why this persona cares:** Financial anxiety is constant; they want reassurance or early warning before things go sideways.

**Solution concept:** A lightweight forecasting tool that says: "At your current burn rate, you're safe / tight / in danger by week X."

**Pain likelihood:** 9/10 — Very real, especially with rent spikes and visa restrictions on income.

---

#### 4. "Who Owes What" Without the Awkwardness
**Problem:** Splitting bills leads to social friction—people forget to pay, rounding feels unfair, and no one wants to nag.

**Why this persona cares:** They value harmony with roommates and don't want to be "the finance cop."

**Solution concept:** An app that sends socially gentle, automated nudges ("Hey! Just settling up for utilities 😊") and supports rounding rules agreed upon upfront.

**Pain likelihood:** 8/10 — Social pain > financial pain here, but very real.

---

#### 5. Multi-Currency Budget That Feels Native
**Problem:** Most budgeting apps assume one currency, breaking down when money comes in and goes out in different currencies.

**Why this persona cares:** They mentally convert everything anyway and constantly feel unsure if they're overspending.

**Solution concept:** A budget where each category has a "home currency," but transactions auto-normalize into a chosen reference currency for clarity.

**Pain likelihood:** 7/10 — Niche but intense when it applies.

---

#### 6. Credit Score for Non-Traditional Backgrounds
**Problem:** International students don't understand how US credit scores work or how to build credit safely.

**Why this persona cares:** Credit affects housing, future jobs, and long-term stability—but the rules feel invisible.

**Solution concept:** A guided "credit path" that explains what to do next each month (open card, keep utilization under X%, when to upgrade).

**Pain likelihood:** 9/10 — High-stakes and poorly explained.

---

#### 7. Rewards-Optimized Bill Splitting
**Problem:** Groups don't optimize who pays for what, so rewards are inefficiently earned or uneven.

**Why this persona cares:** Money is tight, and rewards feel like "free money" they don't want to waste.

**Solution concept:** For shared expenses, the app suggests: "Alex should pay this bill because they'll earn 5% back this month."

**Pain likelihood:** 6/10 — Not essential, but compelling to optimization-minded users.

---

#### 8. Visa-Safe Income & Expense Tracker
**Problem:** Students on visas must track income carefully to avoid violating work restrictions, but current tools don't flag risk.

**Why this persona cares:** Mistakes can have catastrophic consequences (loss of visa status).

**Solution concept:** A tracker that categorizes income sources and warns when you're approaching legal thresholds.

**Pain likelihood:** 8/10 — Quiet, scary, and underserved.

---

#### 9. "Can I Afford This?" Micro-Decision Helper
**Problem:** Small purchases add up, but students don't know when a $40 dinner is actually irresponsible vs. fine.

**Why this persona cares:** They're tired of constant internal debates and guilt around spending.

**Solution concept:** A tap-to-check widget: "If you spend $40 today, you'll still be on track / slightly behind / off track this month."

**Pain likelihood:** 7/10 — Emotionally resonant, behavior-shaping.

---

#### 10. Financial Onboarding for Newly Arrived Students
**Problem:** New international students are dropped into an unfamiliar financial system all at once.

**Why this persona cares:** Early mistakes (bad bank choice, wrong card, overdraft fees) haunt them for years.

**Solution concept:** A step-by-step onboarding flow: bank accounts, credit cards, budgeting norms, bill splitting norms—all tailored to student stipends.

**Pain likelihood:** 9/10 — Big, real, and currently handled via word-of-mouth.

---

### DOMAIN 2: Technical Interview Preparation (10 Concepts)

#### 1. Dead Time = Wasted Prep Time
**Problem:** 30-45 min subway commute each way = 5-7.5 hours/week of potential study time lost. Can't effectively code on laptop while standing/in crowded train.

**Why this persona cares:** MS CS students have 3-6 months to prep for recruiting season while managing coursework. Every hour counts. Missing 20-30 hours/month of prep time could mean the difference between getting offers or not.

**Simple solution:** Mobile-first algorithm flashcards - Swipeable cards with problem → approach → complexity → code snippets. Think "Duolingo for LeetCode" - bite-sized, one-handed, works offline.

**Pain score:** 8/10 - Very real. Every Columbia CS student commutes, and interview prep is high-stakes.

---

#### 2. Pattern Blindness After Solving 200+ Problems
**Problem:** Student solves 200 LeetCode problems but still can't recognize which pattern applies during interviews. No systematic way to review "I've seen this before, what was the trick?"

**Why this persona cares:** Interviewers aren't impressed by memorizing 200 solutions - they want pattern recognition. If you can't identify "this is sliding window" in 30 seconds, you'll waste 20 minutes going down wrong paths.

**Simple solution:** Spaced repetition system for algorithm patterns - App surfaces problems you solved 1 week, 1 month, 3 months ago. Forces you to recall the pattern FIRST, then shows your old solution. Works offline on subway.

**Pain score:** 9/10 - This is THE bottleneck for most students. Memorization ≠ understanding.

---

#### 3. Can't Practice Coding Without a Laptop
**Problem:** Mobile LeetCode is unusable - tiny keyboard, can't see full problem + code + output simultaneously. But you can't type on laptop in a moving subway.

**Why this persona cares:** Coding is muscle memory. Reading solutions isn't the same as typing them out. But commute time is perfect for practice if only the interface worked.

**Simple solution:** Voice-to-code for common patterns - Speak "create two pointers, left equals zero, right equals length minus one" → app writes boilerplate. Focus on logic, not syntax. Review mode shows you saying it vs. working code.

**Pain score:** 6/10 - Cool tech, but voice on subway is awkward. Might work with whisper mode or silent typing simulation.

---

#### 4. Forgetting Problem-Solving Frameworks Under Pressure
**Problem:** Student knows to "draw it out" or "think about edge cases" when calm, but during mock interviews goes blank and jumps straight to coding.

**Why this persona cares:** Interview performance ≠ coding ability. It's about structured thinking under pressure. Need to drill the PROCESS, not just solutions.

**Simple solution:** Timed micro-drills on subway - 2-minute timer: "Given [problem], what's your first step?" Forces you to practice the meta-strategy (clarify → example → approach → code → test). Gamified with streaks.

**Pain score:** 7/10 - Real problem, but students may not realize this is what's holding them back.

---

#### 5. No Offline Access to Study Materials
**Problem:** Subway = spotty WiFi/data. Student downloads LeetCode problems as PDFs but loses syntax highlighting, can't run code, can't see discussions.

**Why this persona cares:** Commute is the only time to study before 8am class. If content doesn't load, that time is gone forever.

**Simple solution:** Offline-first interview prep app - Pre-download problems, video explanations, and interactive diagrams. Smart caching predicts what you'll study next based on your pattern. Works 100% offline.

**Pain score:** 7/10 - NYC subway WiFi is trash. Real blocker for consistent study.

---

#### 6. Can't Track "What Did I Learn Yesterday?"
**Problem:** Student does 5 problems on Monday, but by Thursday forgot which ones they struggled with or what insights they had. No easy way to review personal notes on-the-go.

**Why this persona cares:** Reviewing mistakes is 10x more valuable than solving new problems, but who has time to read through 200 problem notes? Need a system that surfaces the RIGHT review at the RIGHT time.

**Simple solution:** AI-powered "mistake digest" - After each problem, voice-record your "aha moment" (10 sec). App generates daily 5-min podcast-style recap of your learnings. Listen on commute with transcript for quick scan.

**Pain score:** 8/10 - Spaced repetition is proven, but current tools don't make it effortless.

---

#### 7. Shoulder Surfing = Privacy Concerns
**Problem:** Reviewing interview prep on subway means everyone can see your screen. Some students feel self-conscious about mistakes or don't want others to know they're job hunting.

**Why this persona cares:** NYC subway is packed. Showing LeetCode screen = broadcasting "I'm looking for jobs" to classmates, coworkers, or even current employer if you're interning.

**Simple solution:** "Privacy mode" for public practice - Text is slightly blurred unless you focus on specific line. Or audio-only review mode with earbuds. "What's the time complexity of your solution?" → You think → App tells you.

**Pain score:** 4/10 - Nice-to-have, but probably not a core blocker.

---

#### 8. Can't Simulate Interview Pressure During Commute
**Problem:** Student practices problems at their own pace, but interviews are 45-min time-boxed. No way to practice "thinking out loud" or "handling hints" during commute.

**Why this persona cares:** Mock interviews are the best prep, but scheduling them is hard. Need a way to simulate interview conditions daily.

**Simple solution:** AI mock interviewer via voice - App plays interviewer role. Asks problem, listens to your approach, gives hints, asks follow-ups. Works with earbuds on subway. Records session for later review.

**Pain score:** 9/10 - This bridges the gap between solo practice and real interviews. Huge unmet need.

---

#### 9. No Context Switching Between Multiple Study Resources
**Problem:** Student uses LeetCode for problems, Cracking the Coding Interview for patterns, Blind 75 list for prioritization, NeetCode for video explanations, Anki for spaced repetition. Each requires opening different app/website.

**Why this persona cares:** Commute time is limited - can't waste 5 minutes per problem switching contexts. Need everything in one place.

**Simple solution:** All-in-one interview prep aggregator - Pulls problems from LeetCode, attaches NeetCode video, shows pattern from CTCI, tracks in spaced repetition. One app, optimized for mobile, works offline.

**Pain score:** 7/10 - Real friction, but students have workarounds. Convenience play.

---

#### 10. Guilt About "Wasting Time" on Phone
**Problem:** Student scrolls Instagram on subway, feels guilty they're not studying, but opening LeetCode feels overwhelming (where do I start? which problem? I need my laptop...).

**Why this persona cares:** Social proof matters. If "studying" feels easier than scrolling, students will do it. Need to reduce activation energy to near-zero.

**Simple solution:** One-tap daily interview prep - App curates 1 problem per day based on your weak areas + spaced repetition. Notification says "Today: Two Pointers" with one-tap to start. No browsing, no decisions, just start.

**Pain score:** 8/10 - Behavior change is hard. But "daily habit" apps work (Duolingo has 30M DAU). Low-hanging fruit.
