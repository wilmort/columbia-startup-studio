# Lean Canvases - Top 3 Concepts

## Canvas #1: 🥇 Spaced Repetition for Algorithm Patterns

### Problem (Top 3)
1. **Pattern Blindness**: Students solve 200+ LeetCode problems but can't recognize which pattern applies during actual interviews
2. **No Review System**: No systematic way to recall "what was the trick?" for problems solved weeks/months ago
3. **Memorization ≠ Understanding**: Interviews test pattern recognition speed, not solution memorization

### Solution (Top 3 Features)
1. **Smart Resurfacing**: Algorithm shows you problems at spaced intervals (1 week, 1 month, 3 months) based on forgetting curve
2. **Pattern-First Review**: Must identify the pattern category BEFORE seeing your old solution
3. **Offline Mobile-First**: Works on subway with no internet; sync when connected

### Unique Value Proposition
**"Stop memorizing 200 solutions. Start recognizing 15 patterns."**

Duolingo-style spaced repetition for coding interviews. Forces you to recall the pattern before showing the solution. Works offline on your commute.

### Unfair Advantage

2. **Pay-per-interview**: **$3/session** for casual users
3. **B2B**: Bootcamps/universities at **$50/student/semester**

**Unit economics**: $15/month revenue - $3 AI costs = $12 gross margin per user (80% margin)

### Key Metrics
1. **Interviews completed per user per week** - engagement
2. **User-reported helpfulness score** - product-market fit
3. **Free trial → Paid conversion** - monetization
4. **Correlation: # mock interviews → offer rate** - value proof
