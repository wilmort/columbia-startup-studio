## Problem

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Problem confirmed? | ⚠️ Sort of — Admitted it's hard to meet people, but prioritizes efficiency |
| Described unprompted? | No (had to dig) |
| Emotional intensity | 4/10 — Defensive about his workout time |

> *"I'm here to work, not to flirt. I keep my headphones on for a reason."*

**Current solution:** Focuses entirely on academic work and solo training.

**Money spent:** High spend on gear (Garmin watch, expensive shoes).

**Surprise insight:** While he rejected "dating at the gym," he softened when competitive group activities were mentioned. He would join a "Sunday Running League" but not a "Yoga Date."

## Solution Reaction

- Skeptical of the "Post-breakup" branding — thinks it sounds messy.
- **Biggest concern:** "Don't shit where you eat." Terrified of awkward run-ins at the campus gym if a "match" goes bad.

## Overall Signal: 🟡 YELLOW

Mixed signal. This user represents the "Serious Athlete" segment. They are open to connection but hostile to distraction. The "Post-breakup" angle turns them off because it implies drama. They want "Activity Partners," not "Rebounds."

**Takeaway:** Serious hobbyists fear that "dating" features will ruin the sanctuary of their activity; the app must ensure users can toggle between "Social/Casual" and "Serious/Training" modes.
