## Problem

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Problem confirmed? | ✅ Yes — Needs people with shared interests |
| Described unprompted? | No (seems to use school resources heavily) |
| Emotional intensity | 7/10 — Anxiety regarding safety |

> *"Needs someone to walk her home."*

**Current solution:** School resources, WhatsApp groups, college choir/musical clubs.

**Money spent:** Unknown.

**Surprise insight:** She wants multiple shared interests to match, not just one (e.g., not just "yoga," but "yoga + museums").

---

## Solution Reaction

- Validated in-person over online.
- **Biggest concern:** Safety (again). Also contradictory preferences: wants "large groups" to ensure she finds "1–2 people" to hang out with.

## Overall Signal: 🟡 YELLOW

Mixed signal. She is currently well-served by institutional resources (choir/school groups). She represents the user who is busy and might not need an external app unless it offers specific safety guarantees.

**Takeaway:** Matching algorithms need to look at "interest clusters" (multiple shared hobbies) rather than single-interest verticals to satisfy this user type.
