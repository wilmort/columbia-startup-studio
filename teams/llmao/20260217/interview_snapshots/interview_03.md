**Current solution:** Daughter uses Hinge just to find restaurants/events (hacking dating apps for non-dating needs).

**Money spent:** Unknown.

**Surprise insight:** People are using Hinge specifically to find places (restaurants/events), not just people.

## Solution Reaction

## Overall Signal: 🟢 GREEN

Strong proxy signal. While she may be older than the target demographic, her insight that her daughter uses Hinge just to find cool places validates the gap in the market for an event-discovery social app.

**Takeaway:** There is a user behavior of "hacking" dating apps just to find event/venue recommendations — we can streamline this.
