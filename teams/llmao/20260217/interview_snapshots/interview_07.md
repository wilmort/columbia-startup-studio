## Solution Reaction

## Overall Signal: 🟢 GREEN

Strong signal. This user has a high "hair-on-fire" problem (no friends left). He fits the "Rebound/New Start" demographic perfectly and wants exactly what we are building (activities + compassion).

**Takeaway:** For users with high social isolation, the value prop is "Compassion" and "Community," not just "Dating."
