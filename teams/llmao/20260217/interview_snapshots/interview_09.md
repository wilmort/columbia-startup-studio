## Problem

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Problem confirmed? | ✅ Yes — Frustrated by the transactional nature of group classes |
| Described unprompted? | Yes |
| Emotional intensity | 6/10 — Wistful, annoyed |

> *"We sweat together for 45 minutes, experience this intense endorphin rush, and then everyone just puts their AirPods in and walks away. It feels like a wasted opportunity."*

**Current solution:** None. She goes to class, then goes home.

**Money spent:** $0 (Dodge included in tuition), but previously paid for SoulCycle ($30/class) specifically for the "community" vibe — found it cliquey.

**Surprise insight:** She doesn't want a "date" during the workout. She wants the "post-workout smoothie" invite. The activity is the icebreaker, not the date itself.

## Solution Reaction

- Loved the "Events" concept. Specifically mentioned she would join a "Post-Spin Smoothie" group instantly.
- **Biggest concern:** Awkwardness if there is no leader. She doesn't want to be the organizer; she wants the app to tell the group where to go.

## Overall Signal: 🟢 GREEN

Strong signal. Validates the "Activity-based" thesis. Users are already gathering for activities but lack the "permission structure" to transition from activity to socializing. The app provides that permission.

**Takeaway:** The "After-Party" feature (what do we do after the yoga/spin class?) is just as valuable as the matching for the event itself.
