## Problem

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Problem confirmed? | ✅ Yes — Difficulty finding social plans/meeting people in a new city |
| Described unprompted? | Yes |
| Emotional intensity | 6/10 — Anxiety about entering social spaces alone |

> *"Feels weird at events where you go to a new event and don't know anything about anyone."*

**Current solution:** Relies on WhatsApp college groups and mutual friends. Uses social media to find cafes.

**Money spent:** No specific app spend; spends on cafes.

**Surprise insight:** Even though she has a boyfriend, she still struggles with the social aspect of a new city and wants activity partners — not romantic prospects.

## Solution Reaction

- Prefers activity-based events (pilates/yoga/museums) over clubs/bars. Validated the activity concept.
- **Biggest concern:** Social anxiety at the event. Needs a way to communicate/chat before the event to avoid walking in blind.

## Overall Signal: 🟡 YELLOW

Mixed signal. She validates the activity aspect (yoga/pilates) and the pain of moving to NYC, but as she is in a relationship, the "post-breakup" branding might alienate her unless it's framed strictly as social/platonic.

**Takeaway:** Users need a "digital icebreaker" (chat) before the physical event to lower the barrier of entry for introverts.
