**Current solution:** Hangs out with guys to learn the city; relies on extroverted nature.

**Money spent:** Likely high (clubbing, tennis).

**Surprise insight:** He views moving to a new place as requiring a total "mindset shift."

## Solution Reaction

- Interested. Validated the "Tennis date" concept and traditional clubbing.
- **Biggest concern:** Group size. Unlike previous interviewees, he prefers large groups (20+) to guarantee a "vibe match."

## Overall Signal: 🟢 GREEN

Strong signal. A high-energy extrovert who still finds the American social scene "closed" needs an event-based catalyst to break into groups.

**Takeaway:** We need to balance the "Small Group" preference (for depth) with the "Large Group" preference (for statistical probability of matching).
