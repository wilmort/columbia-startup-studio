## Problem

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Problem confirmed? | ✅ Yes — Fear of new locations, strong aversion to dating apps |
| Described unprompted? | Yes |
| Emotional intensity | 8/10 — Strong aversion to standard apps; fear of safety |

> *"Never used dating apps — feels like online shopping for people."*

**Current solution:** Tries new things/events. Used Luma/Eventbrite/District in other countries. Dates via mutuals.

**Money spent:** Likely spends on events/travel.

**Surprise insight:** She explicitly mentioned "fear of locating to new locations" — the barrier isn't just social, it's logistical/safety-based.

## Solution Reaction

- Strong fit for activity-based events (museums/board games). Prefers low-pressure environments.
- **Biggest concern:** Safety. "No way to guarantee security with a date. Needs someone to walk her home."

## Overall Signal: 🟢 GREEN

Strong signal. She is the perfect target persona: recent breakup, hates "shopping" for humans on Tinder/Hinge, wants low-pressure activities, and feels unsafe in the current landscape.

**Takeaway:** Safety features (e.g., verified groups or "walk me home" buddy systems) could be a major differentiator from standard event platforms.
