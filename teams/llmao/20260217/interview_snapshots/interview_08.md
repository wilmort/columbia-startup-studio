## Problem

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Problem confirmed? | ✅ Yes — Using the gym to cope with a breakup, feels lonely |
| Described unprompted? | Yes |
| Emotional intensity | 8/10 — Visibly using exercise as an emotional crutch |

> *"I'm here 6 days a week basically to forget her, but honestly, staring at yourself in the mirror for two hours gets pretty lonely."*

**Current solution:** Working out excessively. Scrolls TikTok between sets.

**Money spent:** $50+/month on pre-workout supplements and protein.

**Surprise insight:** He wants a "gym buddy" just as much as a date. He admitted he's intimidated to talk to other guys to ask for a spot or advice.

## Solution Reaction

- Eyes lit up at the idea of "workout matching." Would love a feature that pairs people for specific workouts (e.g., "Leg Day Partner").
- **Biggest concern:** Flakiness. "If I match with someone for a 6 AM lift and they bail, that ruins my whole morning."

## Overall Signal: 🟢 GREEN

Strong signal. Validates the "Rebound" aspect of the app perfectly. The gym is his "third place," but he lacks the social layer to make it fulfilling. He is high-intent for connection.

**Takeaway:** "Gym bros" are an underserved demographic for platonic/accountability matching — they are lonely but masked by hyper-masculine activity.
