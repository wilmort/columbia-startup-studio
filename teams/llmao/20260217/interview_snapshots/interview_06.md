| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Problem confirmed? | ✅ Yes — Wants efficient matching |
| Described unprompted? | Yes |
| Emotional intensity | 9/10 — Strong negative reaction to branding |

> *"Wouldn't like to use an app that is marketed as post-breakup / rebound... because the people there would be emotionally unstable."*

**Current solution:** Dating apps, Amada app.

**Money spent:** Unknown.

**Surprise insight:** She is the "anti-persona." She wants the feature (activity matching) but hates the brand story (rebound).

## Solution Reaction

- Likes the event/location matching logic (solves the "where do we go?" problem).
- **Biggest concern:** Branding & screening. Wants to screen people before meeting (photo/bio) and avoids "rebound" crowds.

## Overall Signal: 🔴 RED

Weak signal for current positioning. While she likes the mechanics, she explicitly rejected the core "post-breakup" value proposition. If we pivot to general "Activity Dating," she becomes Green.

**Takeaway:** The "Post-breakup" branding is polarizing — it attracts those in pain but actively repels high-intent daters who fear "emotional instability" in others.
