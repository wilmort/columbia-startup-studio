## Key Qualitative Themes
1. **"Everyone comes alone" resonates universally** — This line was the #1 strongest line across all buckets. Addresses the core anxiety directly.
2. **Social proof still feels thin** — Removing placeholders helped, but named quotes without photos still feel manufactured.
3. **Post-hang mechanism unclear** — "We track who you connected with" felt too algorithmic; personas wanted something warmer.
4. **Institutional connector segment struggling** — 58% dealbreaker rate. They want networking, not friend-making. Copy doesn't speak to professional goals.
5. **Price objections halved** — Monthly plan + sliding scale mention resolved most pricing concerns.

## Strongest Lines (by frequency)
1. "Everyone comes alone. That's the whole point." (most cited across all buckets)
2. "The activity carries the conversation"
3. "Know the vibe before you go"
4. "A host who keeps things moving so nobody's standing in a corner"

## Most Common Objections
1. Still unclear how matching/curation works
2. No concrete evidence this has worked for real people
3. Institutional connectors want professional networking, not casual friendship
4. Event_burned_out personas worry about flaking and no-shows
5. What happens if the hang is bad?

## Recommendations for V3
1. **Reframe for aspiration** — Shift headline from addressing anxiety to what you gain
2. **Define the matching** — Explain the curation methodology concretely
3. **Add "tried everything" language** — Validate the experience of serial event attenders
4. **Restructure how-it-works** — Before/During/After journey format
5. **Add Meetup comparison FAQ** — Most common competitive comparison in feedback
