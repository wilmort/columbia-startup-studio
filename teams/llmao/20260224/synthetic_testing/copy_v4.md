## Hero

**Headline:** Everyone comes alone. That's the whole point.

**Subhead:** LLmao matches you into small groups of 6-8 for activity-based hangs — so you can rebuild your social life without the anxiety of walking in blind.

**Micro-line:** Matched by interest. Hosted by a real person. No guessing.

## The real problem isn't finding events

It's the anxiety of showing up.

- You don't know the vibe
- You don't know if you'll fit in
- You don't know if you'll leave feeling worse than when you arrived

When you're starting over — after a breakup, a move, or losing your friend group — every social risk feels bigger. And big events with strangers don't help. They just amplify the uncertainty.

## How LLmao works

We organize **small-group hangs (6-8 people)** around shared activities. Here's what makes them different:

### Before the hang
- **You're matched** with people who share your interests, age range, and vibe preference
- **You see a full preview** — the activity, the people, the vibe, and who's hosting
- **You know the norms** — everyone's there to connect, not perform

### During the hang
- **A trained host** keeps things flowing and makes sure nobody's standing alone
- **The activity does the heavy lifting** — no forced small talk, no awkward silence
- **Small groups only** — 6-8 people, not a sea of strangers

### After the hang
- **Group chat opens** for everyone who attended
- **Follow-up hangs** happen if the group clicks
- **Your matches improve** — we learn what works for you

## What a hang looks like

- Coffee + conversation prompts (6 people, chill)
- Pickup basketball + post-game food (8 people, energetic)
- Museum walk + talk-as-you-go (6 people, social)
- Cooking together + shared meal (6 people, chill)
- Open mic night + debrief (8 people, social)
- Hiking + trailside conversation (8 people, energetic)
- Board games + low-pressure mixing (6 people, chill)
- Park yoga + coffee after (6 people, chill)

**The point:** the activity carries the first 15 minutes for you.

## FAQ

**How is this different from Meetup?**
Meetup is an open event with whoever shows up. LLmao matches you into a small, curated group with a trained host. The difference is structure, size, and intentionality.

**What does "matched" mean?**
We group you with people who share similar interests, age range, and vibe preference. Not random. Intentional.

**What happens after the hang?**
Group chat opens. Follow-up hangs happen naturally. Your future matches improve based on feedback.

**Will this be awkward?**
Everyone comes alone. The activity, small group, and host are specifically designed to eliminate the awkward standing-around problem.

**How do you keep it safe?**
Background context on attendees, trained hosts, behavioral norms, small groups, post-hang feedback system.

**What if I can't afford $10?**
First hang is free. $25/month unlimited is available. Sliding-scale pricing coming soon.
