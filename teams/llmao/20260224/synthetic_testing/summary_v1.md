## Key Qualitative Themes
1. **"Curated" is undefined** — 15+ personas asked what curation actually means in practice
2. **Placeholder social proof kills credibility** — Multiple personas flagged the placeholder quotes as evidence this isn't a real product
3. **Name confusion** — "LLmao" reads as an AI product or tech bro joke
4. **No post-hang mechanism** — Strong concern about what happens after one hang; one event doesn't make a friend group
5. **Price barrier for lower-income personas** — $10/hang is fine for professionals but a real barrier for students, baristas, service workers

## Strongest Lines (by frequency)
1. "The activity carries the first 15 minutes for you" (most cited)
2. "Don't walk in blind"
3. "Know the vibe before you go. No guessing."
4. "You won't be forced to cold-start small talk"

## Most Common Objections
1. No evidence of real hangs having happened
2. "Curated" undefined — who decides groups?
3. No post-hang connection mechanism
4. Scheduling flexibility unaddressed
5. Group size unknown

## Recommendations for V2
1. **Remove placeholder social proof** — Replace with specific claims about the format or remove entirely
2. **Define "curated"** — Explain the matching/curation methodology
3. **Add post-hang connection** — Address what happens after
4. **Add group size info** — Small groups (6-8 people) explicitly stated
5. **Soften price framing** — Add "first hang free" or sliding scale mention
6. **Expand activity types** — Current list feels demographically narrow
