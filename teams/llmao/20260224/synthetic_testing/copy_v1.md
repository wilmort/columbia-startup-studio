## Hero

**Headline:** Don't walk in blind.

**Subhead:** LLmao helps you enter new social circles through curated, activity-based hangs with built-in transparency and norms — so showing up feels easy, not awkward.

**CTA (primary):** Get early access
**CTA (secondary):** Preview upcoming hangs

**Micro-line:** Know the vibe before you go. No guessing.

## Why this feels hard

Walking into a new room is a gamble:

- You don't know the vibe
- You don't know the people
- You don't know if you'll just stand there trying to look busy

When you're rebuilding — after a breakup, a move, or a reset — that uncertainty hits harder.

---

## What LLmao is

LLmao is a platform that organizes **curated, activity-based gatherings** designed to make meeting people feel natural.

Instead of "show up and hope," you get:

- **Structure** (conversation has a reason to happen)
- **Transparency** (you know what you're walking into)
- **Norms** (so the vibe stays respectful + low-pressure)

---

## Transparency + norms

Before you go, you'll have clarity on:

- **What you'll do** (the activity + flow)
- **What the vibe is** (chill / social / energetic)
- **What's expected** (simple norms that prevent weirdness)

Not "rules." Just enough structure so everyone can relax.

---

## How it works

1. **Get early access**
2. **Tell us your city + what you're looking for** (new circle, post-breakup reconnection, social reset)
3. **We notify you when curated hangs drop** — with a clear preview so you can decide fast

---

## Preview upcoming hangs

Here's what "activity-based" actually means:

- Coffee + conversation prompts (small group)
- Museum walk + talk-as-you-go
- Board games + low-pressure mixing
- Park hang + structured intros
- Food crawl + rotating pairs

**The point:** the activity carries the first 15 minutes for you.

---

## Social proof (placeholder copy)

- "I'd show up if I knew what I was walking into."
- "Meetups aren't the issue — uncertainty is."
- "I'm not trying to date. I just want community again."
