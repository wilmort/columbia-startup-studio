## Changes from V1

- **Section:** Social proof
  **Change:** Removed placeholder quotes, replaced with specific format claims ("6-8 people per hang", "hosts trained in group facilitation")
  **Why:** 15+ personas flagged placeholder quotes as credibility-killing. Removing them and replacing with concrete claims addresses the #1 objection.

- **Section:** How it works
  **Change:** Added step about post-hang connection: "After the hang, we open a group chat so you can stay connected"
  **Why:** Top objection across all buckets was "what happens after one hang?" — no path to sustained connection.

- **Section:** What LLmao is
  **Change:** Added explicit group size ("small groups of 6-8"), defined "curated" as "matched by interest, age range, and vibe preference"
  **Why:** "Curated" was the most-questioned word in V1. Defining it concretely addresses the core trust gap.

- **Section:** Pricing
  **Change:** Added "Your first hang is free — no commitment"
  **Why:** Price was a dealbreaker for lower-income personas (students, service workers). Free trial lowers barrier.

- **Section:** Preview upcoming hangs
  **Change:** Expanded activity list to include more diverse options (pickup basketball, open mic night, cooking together, hiking)
  **Why:** V1 activity list felt demographically narrow ("museum walk" read as bougie to several personas).

- **Section:** FAQ
  **Change:** Added "What does 'curated' mean?" and "What happens after the hang?" FAQs
  **Why:** These were the two most common unanswered questions.
