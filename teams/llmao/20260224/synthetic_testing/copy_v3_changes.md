## Changes from V3

- **Section:** Hero headline
  **Change:** Changed from "Don't walk in blind" to "Everyone comes alone. That's the whole point."
  **Why:** This was the #1 strongest line across all V3 personas. It directly addresses the core anxiety.

- **Section:** Hero subhead
  **Change:** Added "so you can rebuild your social life without the anxiety of walking in blind"
  **Why:** More emotionally direct. Names the feeling, not just the feature.

- **Section:** Problem framing
  **Change:** Reframed as "The real problem isn't finding events — it's the anxiety of showing up"
  **Why:** V3 feedback showed personas resonated more with the emotional framing than the logistical one.

- **Section:** How LLmao works
  **Change:** Restructured into Before/During/After format
  **Why:** Clearer journey narrative. Addresses the full experience, not just pre-hang transparency.

- **Section:** Social proof
  **Change:** Added 5th quote ("I've tried meetups, apps, everything. This is the first thing that actually led to friends.")
  **Why:** Directly addresses the "I've tried everything" persona archetype.
