## Hero

**Headline:** Don't walk in blind.

**Subhead:** LLmao matches you into small groups of 6-8 for activity-based hangs — with full transparency on who's there, what you'll do, and what the vibe is.

**CTA (primary):** Get early access — first hang free
**CTA (secondary):** See what a hang looks like

**Micro-line:** Everyone comes alone. That's the whole point.

## Why this feels hard

Walking into a new room is a gamble:

- You don't know the vibe
- You don't know the people
- You don't know if you'll just stand there trying to look busy

When you're rebuilding — after a breakup, a move, or a reset — that uncertainty hits harder. And most "social events" don't solve it. They just put you in a bigger room with more strangers.

---

## What LLmao actually does

We organize **small-group hangs (6-8 people)** built around a shared activity.

Before you go, you'll know:
- **Who's coming** — age range, vibe preference, and what they're looking for
- **What you'll do** — the activity, the flow, and what to expect
- **Who's hosting** — every hang has a trained facilitator who keeps things moving

You're not showing up to a random event. You're joining a group that was put together intentionally.

---

## After the hang

The hang doesn't end when you leave.

- We open a **group chat** for everyone who attended
- You can suggest a follow-up or just stay in touch
- **Recurring hangs** with the same group are available if the group clicks
- We track who you connected with so future matching improves

One hang plants the seed. The group chat lets it grow.

## How it works

1. **Sign up** — your first hang is free, no commitment
2. **Tell us about you** — city, interests, vibe preference (chill / social / energetic), and what you're looking for
3. **We match you** into a small group and send you a full preview
4. **Show up, do the activity, connect** — then stay in touch through the group chat

---

## What a hang actually looks like

- Coffee + conversation prompts (6 people, chill)
- Pickup basketball + post-game food (8 people, energetic)
- Museum walk + talk-as-you-go (6 people, social)
- Cooking together + shared meal (6 people, chill)
- Open mic night + debrief (8 people, social)
- Hiking + trailside conversation (8 people, energetic)
- Board games + low-pressure mixing (6 people, chill)
- Park yoga + coffee after (6 people, chill)

**The point:** the activity carries the first 15 minutes for you.

## From our first hangs

- "I showed up alone and left with three people's numbers. The activity made it easy." — *Sarah, 26, post-breakup*
- "Knowing it was only 6 people made me actually go. Big events paralyze me." — *Marcus, 28, new to NYC*
- "The group chat after was clutch. We're doing another hang next week." — *Priya, 24, social reset*
- "The host made sure nobody was left out. That's what made it different from a meetup." — *James, 27, new city*

## Pricing

**Your first hang is free.**

After that: **$10 per hang** — or **$25/month for unlimited hangs.**

You're paying for intentional matching, a trained host, and a vibe that actually works.

## FAQ

**What does "matched" mean?**
We group you with people who share similar interests, age range, and vibe preference. You're not being thrown into a random crowd.

**What happens after the hang?**
We open a group chat. You can follow up, suggest another hang, or just stay connected. Recurring groups form naturally.

**Who is this for?**
People rebuilding their social life — post-breakup, new city, social reset, or just tired of showing up to things that don't work.

**Will this be awkward if I come alone?**
Everyone comes alone. That's the whole point. The activity + small group + host means you won't be standing in a corner.

**How do you keep it safe?**
Trained hosts, clear behavioral norms, small groups, post-hang feedback, and a zero-tolerance policy for disrespectful behavior.

**What if I can't afford $10?**
Your first hang is always free. After that, we offer a $25/month unlimited plan. We're also exploring sliding-scale options.
