## Hero

**Headline:** Your next friend group starts with one hang.

**Subhead:** LLmao matches you into small groups of 6-8 for activity-based hangs with a trained host — so showing up feels easy, not terrifying.

**CTA (primary):** Try your first hang free
**CTA (secondary):** See what a hang looks like

**Micro-line:** Everyone comes alone. That's the whole point.

## You've tried. It hasn't worked.

You've gone to meetups where nobody talked to you. You've downloaded apps that led nowhere. You've said yes to events and left early because nobody made space for you.

The problem isn't effort. It's format.

Big groups. No structure. No follow-up. No reason to talk to anyone specific. That's why it feels like you keep trying and nothing sticks.

---

## LLmao fixes the format

We organize **small-group hangs (6-8 people)** around shared activities. Every hang has:

- **Intentional matching** — grouped by interest, age range, and vibe
- **A trained host** — someone who keeps things flowing and makes sure nobody's left out
- **Full transparency** — you see the activity, the vibe, the group, and the host before you commit
- **A built-in follow-up** — group chat opens after, recurring hangs happen if the group clicks

This isn't an event you attend. It's a group you join.

## What a hang looks like

| Activity | Group size | Vibe |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Coffee + conversation prompts | 6 | Chill |
| Pickup basketball + post-game food | 8 | Energetic |
| Museum walk + talk-as-you-go | 6 | Social |
| Cooking together + shared meal | 6 | Chill |
| Open mic night + debrief | 8 | Social |
| Hiking + trailside conversation | 8 | Energetic |
| Board games + mixing | 6 | Chill |
| Park yoga + coffee after | 6 | Chill |

**The activity carries the first 15 minutes for you.**

## How it works

1. **Sign up** — your first hang is free
2. **Tell us about you** — interests, vibe preference, what you're looking for
3. **Get matched** — we send you a full preview of your hang
4. **Show up and connect** — then stay in touch through the group chat

## Pricing

**Your first hang is free.** No card required.

After that: **$10 per hang** or **$25/month unlimited.**

## FAQ

**How is this different from Meetup?**
Small matched groups, trained hosts, structured activities, and a follow-up system. Meetup is an open event. LLmao is an intentional group.

**Will this be awkward?**
Everyone comes alone. The activity, small group, and host eliminate the standing-around-in-silence problem. And your first one is free, so there's no risk.

**What happens after?**
Group chat. Follow-up hangs. Better future matches based on your feedback.

**How do you keep it safe?**
Trained hosts, behavioral norms, small groups, feedback after every hang.

**What if I can't afford $10?**
First hang is free. Monthly unlimited is $25. Sliding scale coming soon.
