## Changes from V4

- **Section:** Hero headline
  **Change:** Changed to "Your next friend group starts with one hang."
  **Why:** V4 showed high resonance but the headline was about anxiety. Shifting to aspiration — what you GET, not what you avoid.

- **Section:** Problem framing
  **Change:** Added "You've tried. It hasn't worked." opening with specific failed attempts
  **Why:** V4 data showed personas who'd tried other things had higher conversion. Naming their history validates their experience.

- **Section:** Core pitch
  **Change:** Added "This isn't an event you attend. It's a group you join."
  **Why:** Strongest differentiator from Meetup/Eventbrite. Reframes the mental model.

- **Section:** Hang format
  **Change:** Switched to table format for cleaner scanning
  **Why:** V4 personas were already sold on the concept; they wanted quick reference, not persuasion.

- **Section:** Social proof
  **Change:** Switched to blockquote format. Added 6th quote about social anxiety being universal.
  **Why:** Devon's quote normalizes the fear. Multiple personas said "I'm scared I'll be the most awkward one there."

- **Section:** Final CTA
  **Change:** "Stop waiting for someone to invite you. Be the person who shows up."
  **Why:** Action-oriented. Shifts from passive to active. Tested well in V4 gut reactions.
