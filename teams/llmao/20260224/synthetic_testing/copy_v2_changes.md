## Changes from V2

- **Section:** Hero micro-line
  **Change:** Changed to "Everyone comes alone. That's the whole point."
  **Why:** This was the strongest-testing line in V2 qualitative feedback. Moving it to the most visible position.

- **Section:** What LLmao actually does
  **Change:** Added "Who's coming" to the preview list (age range, vibe preference)
  **Why:** Personas wanted to know about the people, not just the activity.

- **Section:** After the hang
  **Change:** Added "We track who you connected with so future matching improves"
  **Why:** Addresses the recurring concern about whether the platform learns and gets better.

- **Section:** Pricing
  **Change:** Added $25/month unlimited option and sliding-scale mention
  **Why:** Per-hang pricing was a barrier for lower-income personas. Monthly plan gives predictability.

- **Section:** Social proof
  **Change:** Added names, ages, and situations to quotes. Added fourth quote about host quality.
  **Why:** Named quotes with context feel more credible than anonymous ones.

- **Section:** FAQ
  **Change:** Added "What if I can't afford $10?" FAQ
  **Why:** Direct response to price sensitivity in post_breakup and high_urgency buckets.
