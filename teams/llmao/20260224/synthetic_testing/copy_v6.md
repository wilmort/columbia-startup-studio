## Hero

**Headline:** Your next friend group starts with one hang.

**Subhead:** Small groups. Shared activities. A host who makes sure nobody stands alone. This is how you rebuild your social life — one hang at a time.

**CTA (primary):** Try your first hang free
**CTA (secondary):** See what a hang looks like

**Micro-line:** Everyone comes alone. That's the whole point.

## You've tried. It hasn't worked.

You've gone to meetups where nobody talked to you. Downloaded apps that led nowhere. Said yes to events and left early because nobody made space for you.

The problem isn't effort. It's format. Big groups, no structure, no follow-up, no reason to talk to anyone specific.

**LLmao fixes the format.**

---

## How it works

**Small groups (6-8 people)** matched by interest, age, and vibe. A shared activity that does the social heavy lifting. A trained host who keeps things flowing.

### Before
You see everything: the activity, the vibe, the group size, who's hosting. You decide if it's for you. No blind commitment.

### During
The activity carries the first 15 minutes. The host makes sure nobody's standing alone. The small group means you actually get to know people.

### After
Group chat opens. Follow-up hangs happen if the group clicks. Your future matches improve based on feedback.

**This isn't an event you attend. It's a group you join.**

## FAQ

**How is this different from Meetup?** Small matched groups, trained hosts, structured activities, follow-up system. Meetup is an open event. LLmao is an intentional group.

**Will it be awkward?** Everyone comes alone. Activity + small group + host = no standing around in silence.

**What happens after?** Group chat. Follow-up hangs. Better matches over time.

**Safe?** Trained hosts, norms, small groups, post-hang feedback system.

**Can't afford $10?** First hang free. $25/month unlimited. Sliding scale coming.
