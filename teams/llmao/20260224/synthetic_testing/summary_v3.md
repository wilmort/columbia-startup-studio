## Per-Bucket Performance
| Bucket | Resonance | Intent | Conversion | Dealbreakers |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| high_urgency_reset | 92% | 100% | 58% | 0% |
| post_breakup_rebound | 83% | 25% | 25% | 42% |
| institutional_connector | 67% | 8% | 25% | 8% |
| event_burned_out | 58% | 33% | 25% | 17% |
| new_city_rebuilder | 33% | 50% | 25% | 42% |

## Key Observations
1. **Resonance surged (+20pp) but intent/conversion flat** — People feel seen but aren't convinced to act. The emotional framing lands but the product pitch isn't converting interest into intent.
2. **High urgency reset is the standout segment** — 92% resonance, 100% intent, 58% conversion, 0% dealbreakers. This is the beachhead segment.
3. **Post-breakup resonance high (83%) but conversion low (25%)** — They relate strongly to the problem but have price sensitivity and trust concerns about meeting strangers.
4. **New city rebuilder still underperforming** — 33% resonance despite being a natural fit. The copy doesn't address the "new to this city" experience specifically enough.
5. **Before/During/After structure worked** — Clearer journey narrative. Personas stopped asking "what actually happens?"

## Strongest Lines (by frequency)
1. "Everyone comes alone. That's the whole point." (still #1)
2. "I've tried meetups, apps, everything. This is the first thing that actually led to friends."
3. "The real problem isn't finding events — it's the anxiety of showing up"
4. "A host who makes sure nobody stands alone"

## Most Common Objections
1. "Sounds great but I need more proof it works" — social proof still insufficient
2. New city rebuilders: "Doesn't mention being new to the area"
3. Post-breakup: "Not ready to put myself out there with strangers"
4. Institutional connectors: Low intent despite reduced dealbreakers
5. What cities is this available in?

## Recommendations for V4
1. **Shift headline to aspiration** — "Your next friend group starts with one hang"
2. **Add "tried everything" validation** — Name specific failed attempts (Bumble BFF, Meetup, Discord)
3. **Reframe from event → group** — "This isn't an event you attend. It's a group you join."
4. **Clean up format** — Table-based hang format for quick scanning
5. **Add Devon's quote** — Normalize social anxiety as universal
6. **Action-oriented CTA** — "Stop waiting for someone to invite you."
