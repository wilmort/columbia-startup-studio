# V5 Evaluation Summary

## Top-Line Metrics
- **Resonance:** 82% agree+ (up from 68% V4)
- **Intent:** 65% agree+ (unchanged from V4)
- **Conversion Confidence:** 70% agree+ (up from 58% V4)
- **Dealbreakers:** 7% (down from 13% V4)
- **Clarity:** 80% nailed_it, 20% partial, 0% wrong

## Delta from V4
| Metric | V4 | V5 | Delta |
|--------|----|----|-------|
| Resonance agree+ | 68% | 82% | +14pp |
| Intent agree+ | 65% | 65% | 0pp |
| Conversion agree+ | 58% | 70% | +12pp |
| Dealbreakers | 13% | 7% | -6pp |

## Per-Bucket Performance
| Bucket | Resonance | Intent | Conversion | Dealbreakers |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| high_urgency_reset | 100% | 83% | 100% | 0% |
| event_burned_out | 83% | 25% | 58% | 8% |
| post_breakup_rebound | 83% | 92% | 75% | 8% |
| new_city_rebuilder | 75% | 75% | 67% | 17% |
| institutional_connector | 67% | 50% | 50% | 0% |

## Key Observations
1. **Resonance hit 82%** — Highest ever. The host-centered messaging and direct address of event fatigue worked.
2. **Event burned out breakthrough** — 83% resonance (up from 33%). "Tired of trying? We get it." + host quality emphasis finally reached this segment.
3. **Conversion at 70%, well above 50% stopping threshold** — Study could stop here, but V6 refinement is worthwhile.
4. **Intent plateaued at 65%** — Resonance→intent gap suggests some personas feel understood but still aren't fully convinced to act.
5. **Only 4 dealbreakers remain** — Down from 52/60 at baseline. Residual dealbreakers are edge cases, not systemic.
6. **Host quality is the #1 differentiator** — Most-cited reason for positive intent across all buckets.

## Strongest Lines (by frequency)
1. "A host who makes sure nobody stands alone" (new #1)
2. "Your next friend group starts with one hang"
3. "Everyone comes alone. That's the whole point."
4. "This isn't an event you attend. It's a group you join."

## Most Common Objections
1. Event burned out: Still some residual "prove it" energy (but intent only 25%)
2. New city rebuilder: "What cities is this in?" — availability concern
3. Copy is getting long — several personas noted TL;DR fatigue
4. Institutional connector: Intent rising but slowly

## Recommendations for V6
1. **Cut copy by ~20%** — Tighter is better when resonance is this high
2. **Condense FAQ to 1-2 sentences per answer** — Quick reference, not sales pitch
3. **Consolidate how-it-works** — Single flowing section instead of separate blocks
4. **Keep host messaging front and center** — It's working; don't bury it
5. **This is the refinement round** — No more revolution, just polish
