## Key Observations
1. **Massive conversion jump (+26pp)** — The shift from "event you attend → group you join" fundamentally changed intent. Personas stopped comparing to Meetup.
2. **Intent surged (+22pp)** — "Your next friend group starts with one hang" turned aspiration into action. The headline works.
3. **New city rebuilder breakthrough** — Jumped from 33% to 75% resonance. The "tried everything" validation landed with this segment.
4. **High urgency reset near-perfect** — 100/92/92. This segment is fully converted.
5. **Event burned out still struggling** — 33% resonance unchanged from V3. These personas are tired of trying new things. The copy needs to address their fatigue directly.
6. **Conversion passed 50% threshold** — Meeting stopping criteria for the first time.

## Strongest Lines (by frequency)
1. "Your next friend group starts with one hang" (new #1)
2. "This isn't an event you attend. It's a group you join."
3. "You've tried. It hasn't worked."
4. "Stop waiting for someone to invite you. Be the person who shows up."
5. Devon's quote about social anxiety being universal

## Most Common Objections
1. Event burned out: "Another thing promising it'll be different"
2. Institutional connector: "Still unclear on professional value"
3. Post-breakup: Residual trust concerns about group dynamics
4. Cancellation/refund policy unclear
5. How far in advance can I see who's coming?

## Recommendations for V5
1. **Address event fatigue directly** — Name it: "Tired of trying? We get it."
2. **Host quality as differentiator** — Make the host the star; it's the #1 thing that distinguishes this from all other options
3. **Tighten copy length** — Personas who are sold don't need more persuasion
4. **Add host detail** — "A host who makes sure nobody stands alone"
5. **Condense FAQ** — By V5, copy should answer most questions. Short answers only.
