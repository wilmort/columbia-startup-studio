## Changes from V5

- **Section:** Hero subhead
  **Change:** Expanded to include "A host who makes sure nobody stands alone"
  **Why:** Host quality was the #1 differentiator mentioned in V5 positive feedback.

- **Section:** How it works
  **Change:** Condensed into a single flowing section with Before/During/After headers
  **Why:** V5 was long. Personas who were already convinced didn't need as much persuasion. Tightened the copy.

- **Section:** FAQ
  **Change:** Shortened all answers to 1-2 sentences
  **Why:** By V6, the copy should have answered most questions already. FAQ is a quick reference, not a sales pitch.

- **Section:** Overall
  **Change:** Reduced total copy length by ~20%
  **Why:** V5 conversion was strong. V6 goal is refinement, not revolution. Tighter copy respects the reader's time.
