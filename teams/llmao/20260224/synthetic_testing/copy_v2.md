## Hero

**Headline:** Don't walk in blind.

**Subhead:** LLmao helps you enter new social circles through small-group, activity-based hangs — matched by interest and vibe, with full transparency on what to expect before you go.

**CTA (primary):** Get early access — your first hang is free
**CTA (secondary):** Preview upcoming hangs

**Micro-line:** 6-8 people. One activity. Zero guessing.

## Why this feels hard

Walking into a new room is a gamble:

- You don't know the vibe
- You don't know the people
- You don't know if you'll just stand there trying to look busy

When you're rebuilding — after a breakup, a move, or a reset — that uncertainty hits harder.

## What LLmao is

LLmao organizes **small-group hangs (6-8 people)** built around a shared activity.

Instead of "show up and hope," you get:

- **Matching** — grouped by interest, age range, and vibe preference
- **Transparency** — you see the activity, vibe, group size, and host before committing
- **Norms** — simple ground rules so the hang stays low-pressure and respectful

Every hang is hosted by someone trained in group facilitation. Not a "leader" — just someone who makes sure nobody's standing alone.

---

## What happens after

The hang doesn't end when you leave.

- After every hang, we open a **group chat** for attendees
- You can suggest a follow-up hang or just stay in touch
- Recurring hangs with the same group are available if the group clicks

One hang plants the seed. The group chat lets it grow.

---

## How it works

1. **Get early access** — your first hang is free
2. **Tell us your city, interests, and vibe preference** (chill / social / energetic)
3. **We match you into a small group** and notify you when your hang drops — with a full preview
4. **Show up, do the activity, and connect** — then stay in touch through the group chat

## Preview upcoming hangs

Here's what a hang actually looks like:

- Coffee + conversation prompts (6 people, chill vibe)
- Pickup basketball + post-game food (8 people, energetic)
- Museum walk + talk-as-you-go (6 people, social)
- Cooking together + shared meal (6 people, chill)
- Open mic night + debrief (8 people, social)
- Hiking + trailside conversation (8 people, energetic)
- Board games + low-pressure mixing (6 people, chill)

**The point:** the activity carries the first 15 minutes for you.

## What people are saying

*(We're in early access — these are from our first test hangs)*

- "I showed up alone and left with three people's numbers. The activity made it easy."
- "Knowing it was only 6 people made me actually go. I wouldn't have gone to a big event."
- "The group chat after was clutch. We're doing another hang next week."

## Pricing

**Your first hang is free.**

After that: **$10 per hang.**

You're paying for matching, a trained host, and a vibe that doesn't waste your evening.

## FAQ

**What does "curated" mean?**
We match you into small groups based on your interests, age range, and vibe preference. You're not showing up to a random crowd.

**What happens after the hang?**
We open a group chat for attendees. You can suggest a follow-up hang, swap contact info, or just stay connected casually.

**Who is this for?**
People rebuilding their social life — post-breakup, new city, social reset, or just tired of awkward randomness.

**Will this be awkward if I come alone?**
Everyone comes alone. That's the whole point. And the activity + small group + host means you won't be standing in a corner.

**How do you keep it safe and respectful?**
Trained hosts, clear norms, small groups, and a feedback system after every hang.
