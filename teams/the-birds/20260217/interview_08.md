# Interview_08

## Interview Time

**11:10 -- 11:27**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Tell me about your day-to-day routine as a student currently.

Wake up → Gym → Breakfast (bagel, sometimes coffee) → Class (on days he
has class) → Lunch → Another class (if applicable) → Study until dinner
→ Shower and sleep.

Weekends follow the same structure but without classes. He studies in
the library and prefers **Butler**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Tell me about the last time you sat down to work.

He was preparing for an interview on the same day it was scheduled. He
was trying to master the concepts before the interview time.

**How he felt:**\
He felt stressed and worried, but ultimately reassured that he knew the
concepts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Walk me through a recent instance where you lost track of time.

He had a seminar at 7:00 PM that ended around 8:30 PM. He then went to
dinner, overate, and dinner was slow. Afterward, he sat down to study
and noticed it was already 10-something.

He believes being tired, not wanting to "lock in," and not having strict
deadlines contributed to this.

No strict deadlines imply no pressure to finish within a specific time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. If you could change one habit or struggle in your life, what would you change?

He would sleep earlier as much as possible. He currently has an unstable
sleep schedule (partly due to a friend visiting). On a good night, he
sleeps at 11:00 PM.

Other than that, he does not feel he has trouble fixing his sleep
schedule.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Tell me about the last time you tried to rest.

He went on a trip to DC with a friend. He decided to let go of work
because his friend was leaving soon and he wanted to relax.

He believes rest is essential and recognizes the risk of burnout, but he
does not fear burning out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. How do you feel when you are not working or studying?

It depends on the time scale.

-   If it is for a long time (more than two weeks), he feels
    unproductive.\
-   If it is shorter, he feels good and rested.

He believes good rest "recharges his batteries" and gives him a huge
boost.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Tell me about a time in the last few months when you felt burnout.

During finals, he felt tired and overwhelmed. He had to prepare many
cheat sheets and had multiple exams within a few days, meaning a lot to
study in a short period of time. He lost sleep.

He believes he should have prepared better during the semester. He
underestimated the difficulty of finals.

When asked about a wake-up call, he mentioned midterms, but he was
already tired after midterms and was not studying efficiently.

He uses Excel sheets to try to work more efficiently. He says they work
"half and half."\
- They are great visualization tools.\
- They do not help him manage tasks effectively.

He often falls short in managing tasks. However, they help him stay
aware of what needs to be done, which he believes solves half the
problem.

He feels the real problem is actually doing the work, not starting it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Walk me through your sleep routine last night.

He slept at 3:00 AM and woke up at 10:00 AM.

He folded his laundry and called his mother. He thinks he should have
done that earlier but procrastinated.

**Follow-up: How have you tried to fight procrastination?**\
He tries to "just do stuff" and avoid using his phone. He keeps it out
of sight and out of reach. His phone is one of his biggest distractions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Tell me about a time when you had a bad week.

Finals week.

He was tired, sleep-deprived, stressed, overwhelmed, and had a lot of
work to do.

**What did you do to feel better?**\
He did not have time to feel better. He just wanted to push through and
get it over with.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Tell me about a time you compared yourself to a peer.

He used to compare himself frequently during undergrad. He was
fascinated by how others seemed to grasp concepts faster.

Eventually, he realized that everyone struggles in different ways and
that situations are not comparable. Everyone has unique circumstances
that shape their difficulties.

When he compared himself, he felt horrible: - Not comfortable with
himself\
- Doubting his abilities and skills\
- Experiencing imposter syndrome\
- Feeling like he did not deserve to be there\
- Doubting his intelligence
