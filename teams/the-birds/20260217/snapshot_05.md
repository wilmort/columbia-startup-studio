## Who Did You Talk To?

| --- | --- |
| **Name / Description** | Peter (Late 20s, Dutch, MSE Engineering Major, prefers I-House social life) |
| **How you found them** | Randomly asking in school dormitory common lounge space |

## What Did You Learn?

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Problem confirmed?** | **Y** (Event discovery fragmentation; information overload from emails) |
| **Key quote** | "Often misses out on events he is actually interested in because he doesn't read every email." |
| **Emotional intensity** | **6/10** (Frustrated by "chaos" and "app fatigue"; annoyed by the mixing of career and social spam) |
| **Current solution** | Relying on physical proximity (I-House lounges) to bump into people; ignoring most emails. |
| **Money spent?** | **N** (Relies on serendipity and free lists). |
| **Surprise** | He explicitly *dislikes* using Instagram for school events, which contradicts the norm for many students; prefers Email/Calendar but wants it cleaned up. |

## Solution Reaction

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Their reaction** | **Anti-App / Pro-Integration.** |
| **Key quote** | "Tired of downloading new apps; wants solutions that integrate naturally." |
| **Biggest concern** | **Friction/Adoption.** If it requires a new download or login, he likely won't use it. He wants "automatic matching" and "seamless RSVP." |

## Commitments

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Referral?** | N |
| **Follow-up?** | Y (To test a "Calendar-integrated" social tool) |
| **Pre-purchase?** | N |

## Overall Signal

**Circle one:**

🟢 **GREEN** — Strong signal. He identified a clear problem (event discovery fragmentation) and a clear constraint (no new apps). This is a "Green" signal for a specific *kind* of solution (e.g., a smart calendar plugin or email digester), even if he's "Red" for a standalone social app.

## One-Sentence Takeaway

*What's the single most important thing you learned from this interview?*

**Peter wants social connection but refuses to download another app to find it; the solution must live inside his existing Email or Calendar.**
