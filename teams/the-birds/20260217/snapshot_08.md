  **Name / Description**             Maurice (Early-20s, Financial

## What Did You Learn?

  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  **Problem confirmed?**             **Y** (Procrastination, sleep
                                     instability, burnout during
                                     high-pressure periods)

  **Key quote**                      "The real problem is actually
                                     doing the work, not starting it."

  **Emotional intensity**            **7/10** (Stress during
                                     finals/interviews; past imposter
                                     syndrome)

  **Current solution**               Excel sheets for visualization;
                                     hiding phone to reduce
                                     distraction; pushing through
                                     during burnout

  **Money spent?**                   No (uses free tools like Excel)

  **Surprise**                       He is structured and self-aware,
                                     yet execution (actually doing the
                                     work) remains the main struggle.

## Solution Reaction

  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  **Their reaction**                 Interested in execution-focused
                                     tools, not just planning tools.
                                     Visualization alone does not solve
                                     follow-through.

  **Key quote**                      "They are great visualization
                                     tools... but they do not help me
                                     manage tasks effectively."

  **Biggest concern**                Execution gap. Any solution must
                                     directly improve follow-through
                                     without adding friction.

## Commitments

  ------------------- ---
  **Referral?**       N
  **Follow-up?**      Y
  **Pre-purchase?**   N
  ------------------- ---

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overall Signal

**YELLOW --- Mixed signal. Problem exists but urgency and willingness to
pay are unclear. Needs more validation.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-Sentence Takeaway

Maurice doesn't need more structure --- he needs a system that drives
execution when motivation drops.
