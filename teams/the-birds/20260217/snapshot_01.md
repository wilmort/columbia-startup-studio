## Who Did You Talk To?

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Name / Description** | Vijeet (Late 20s, Math Finance Major, ambitious, health-conscious) |
| **How you found them** | Randomly asking in school dormitory common lounge space |

## What Did You Learn?

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Problem confirmed?** | **Y** (Food logistics and decision fatigue regarding meals) |
| **Key quote** | "Deciding *what* to eat and *when* to make it." |
| **Emotional intensity** | **7/10** (High focus on efficiency; "logistics are paramount") |
| **Current solution** | Eating at Raising Cane’s (110th) or Halal trucks; attempting to learn to cook. |
| **Money spent?** | Yes (Frequent takeout/dining out). |
| **Surprise** | Despite being "not a picky eater" and very busy, he is trying to learn to cook rather than just relying 100% on efficient takeout. |

## Solution Reaction

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Their reaction** | **Skeptical about the "random questions" aspect.** He liked the integration of logistics (weather/location/availability) but felt the mood discovery might be inefficient. |
| **Key quote** | "If I have to answer questions to get food, that kills the efficiency. I just want the logistics solved." |
| **Biggest concern** | **Friction.** As a math/finance guy who optimizes walking routes, he worries the "random questions" add unnecessary time to the process. |

## Commitments

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Referral?** | N |
| **Follow-up?** | Y |
| **Pre-purchase?** | N |

## Overall Signal

**Circle one:**

🟡 **YELLOW** — Mixed signal. The problem (logistics/decision fatigue) is very strong for him, but the specific solution mechanism (mood-based questions) conflicts with his primary value of efficiency. He wants a tool, not a game.

## One-Sentence Takeaway

*What's the single most important thing you learned from this interview?*

**Vijeet needs a logistics solver, not a mood explorer; he will only use the app if it is faster than walking to Raising Cane's.**
