                                     undergraduate, research-focused,
                                     structured planner, disciplined
                                     but social-media distracted)

## What Did You Learn?

  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  **Problem confirmed?**             **Y** (Social media distraction;
                                     anxiety when work is unfinished;
                                     burnout during intense periods)

  **Key quote**                      "If I am not studying but know
                                     there is work to be done, I feel
                                     very anxious."

  **Emotional intensity**            **8/10** (Burnout during finals &
                                     grad apps; strong emotional week
                                     due to family loss)

  **Current solution**               Uses Stay Free app; considering
                                     purchasing the Brick device (\$60)
                                     to block apps

  **Money spent?**                   Potentially yes (willing to pay
                                     for a hardware-based solution)

  **Surprise**                       He is willing to invest money in a
                                     physical tool to enforce focus ---
                                     strong behavioral signal.

## Solution Reaction

  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------
  **Their reaction**                 Receptive to strong,
                                     friction-based focus tools.
                                     Already experimenting with
                                     blockers.

  **Key quote**                      The iPhone feature "did not work
                                     well," so he downloaded a stronger
                                     blocker.

  **Biggest concern**                Effectiveness. He wants proof that
                                     a solution truly works before
                                     committing.

## Commitments

  ------------------- -----------
  **Referral?**       N
  **Follow-up?**      Y
  **Pre-purchase?**   Potential
  ------------------- -----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overall Signal

**GREEN --- Strong signal. Clear pain, active experimentation, and
willingness to spend money. Move forward.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## One-Sentence Takeaway

Nicolas will pay for a solution that enforces focus --- if it
demonstrably works better than existing blockers.
