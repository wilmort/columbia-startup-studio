# Interview_09

## Interview Time

**11:38 -- 12:09**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Tell me about your day-to-day routine as a student currently.

He is currently on a research exchange in Sydney.

He wakes up at 6:30 AM, leaves at 7:30 AM, arrives on campus at 8:45 AM,
and works for about 3 hours (research, seminars, etc.).\
Lunch is from 12:00--1:00 PM. From 1:00--4:00 PM, he continues working
or joins various activities.\
From 4:00--5:00 PM, he goes to the gym, then goes home for dinner and
completes any remaining work.

During weekends, it depends on what is happening. On Saturdays, he may
go out with his uncles or grandfather to say a prayer at the cemetery,
then have breakfast, go out with friends, or fill out master's
applications.\
Sundays are dedicated to family time: BBQs, visiting cousins, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Tell me about the last time you sat down to work.

This morning he arrived at the university. He had recently proved an
important result, polished the proof, and then started writing it in
LaTeX, which took up his entire day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Walk me through a recent instance where you lost track of time.

This afternoon when he went for mass, there was a barbecue outside. He
was talking to people and apparently 2 hours felt like 20 minutes.

In terms of work, when writing in LaTeX, he can sit for 3 hours without
noticing if he is very focused. He only gets up when he gets hungry;
otherwise, he is completely locked in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. If you could change one habit or struggle in your life, what would you change?

He would change his addiction to social media. He spends too much time
scrolling, which ruins his focus and takes time away from work.

He downloaded an app called **Stay Free** because he found that the
iPhone feature did not work well. It blocks selected apps but requires
extra steps. It has been working fine (maximum 10 minutes on Instagram
per day).

He is considering investing in a device called **Brick**. It is a cube
that you tap your phone on to block selected apps (through an app). You
can customize it. The only way to unblock apps is to tap it again. For
example, you can leave the Brick out of reach.

It costs \$60, and students have a discount. He discovered it on
Instagram and has researched reviews.\
He trusts reviews to some extent but acknowledges they could be bots. He
believes the best way to evaluate it would be to test it or speak to
someone who has used it. Reviews provide information but do not give the
full picture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Tell me about the last time you tried to rest.

He last rested while sitting with his uncle in front of the TV. They
watched a comedy series and many episodes because he had a long day
before. He got a good night of sleep afterward.

He defines rest as actively doing something that is not studying or
working. Simply doing nothing does not feel like rest to him unless that
is someone's personal idea of rest. He prefers activities such as
watching TV or going out for dinner to feel rested.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. How do you feel when you are not working or studying?

It depends.

If he is not studying but knows there is work to be done, he feels very
anxious because he knows it must be completed.

If he has finished what he planned for the day, he feels much better.

He prefers daily planning rather than weekly because otherwise he feels
overwhelmed and unproductive.\
If he knows a month will be tough, he sets precise dates, visualizes
everything that must be done, and once everything is structured, he
knows what to focus on.

He plans the entire week but works day by day toward weekly goals,
setting daily checkpoints.

To visualize tasks, he creates a chart in Google Docs. The columns
represent days of the week like a calendar. He writes what he wants to
accomplish each day, leaves blanks for flexibility, and mainly includes
academic tasks, sometimes social plans as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Tell me about a time in the last few months when you felt burnout.

There were two occasions.

First, during finals week last December. He had five exams in one week,
and one course (functional programming) was particularly difficult. No
matter how much time he spent, it was not clicking, which caused
burnout.

Second, two to three weeks ago while finishing graduate school
applications. He was tired of looking at the same personal statement
since September. He felt burned out and believes he could have improved
the last statement.

He applied to seven schools but wanted to apply to one or two more. He
believes graduate applications are inherently exhausting because
statements are similar across schools, and writing completely new ones
would also cause burnout.

He views graduate applications as a four-month intense period.
Internship applications, in his opinion, depend heavily on luck, while
most of his experience is research-based.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Walk me through your sleep routine last night.

He got home from his uncle's house at around 10:30 PM. He got ready for
bed (he showers in the morning), finished toiletries at 11:15 PM, sat in
bed, prayed the rosary, and then went to sleep.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Tell me about a time when you had a bad week.

The week his grandmother passed away in October. He also had midterms
that week.

There was a buildup to her death, which was a constant source of stress.
He had two exams (Thursday and Friday), and she had a near-death
experience the Wednesday before. He also had stress related to traveling
that weekend and could not attend her funeral.

### What did you do to feel better?

He cried a lot. A friend supported him, and when he returned home, his
father was there for support (his mother was not there). It took time to
feel better. It was difficult for him to go to Australia because his
grandmother was there.

It did not affect his academic performance, but it affected him
personally. He was grieving and reminded of her often. By finals, he had
learned to live with it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Tell me about a time you compared yourself to a peer.

During undergrad, he compared himself to people who cheated on exams.
They were getting better opportunities while he was not.

He felt betrayed because he had worked hard for results that did not
reflect his capabilities. He believes those students may have received
higher grades than they deserved.

It did not affect his academic performance, though it may have impacted
grading curves. It did not affect his self-esteem.
