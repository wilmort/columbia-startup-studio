## Who Did You Talk To?

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Name / Description** | Wanonno (Late 20s, Japan, SIPA student, sleep-deprived, heavy writer) |
| **How you found them** | Randomly asking in school dormitory common lounge space |

## What Did You Learn?

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Problem confirmed?** | **Y** (Fragmented knowledge management; cannot easily find/query his past essays across divergent cloud storage) |
| **Key quote** | "Cloud storages are divergent, making it hard to connect with GenAI." |
| **Emotional intensity** | **8/10** (Frustrated by the loss of his 3-monitor setup and the inefficiency of searching his own work) |
| **Current solution** | Manual search across disparate cloud services; using Twitter as a makeshift journal/news aggregator. |
| **Money spent?** | **Y** (Implicitly pays for/uses multiple AI tools: ChatGPT for writing, Gemini for OCR). |
| **Surprise** | He uses Gemini specifically for OCR because he finds ChatGPT's OCR poor; he journals privately on Twitter. |

## Solution Reaction

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Their reaction** | **Requesting a "Second Brain" / Search Tool.** |
| **Key quote** | "Wishlist: A search query system to find previous essays/topics he has written about." |
| **Biggest concern** | **Integration.** His current files are "divergent," so any solution must unify these distinct sources (Cloud, Local, etc.). |

| **Referral?** | N |
| **Follow-up?** | Y (To test a prototype for "Essay Search/Knowledge Base") |

## Overall Signal

**Circle one:**

🟢 **GREEN** — Strong signal. He has a high-volume output (heavy essay writing) and a specific, technical pain point (retrieval of past work) that current tools aren't solving well for him.

## One-Sentence Takeaway

*What's the single most important thing you learned from this interview?*

**Wanonno represents the "Power User Student" who needs a unified 'Personal Knowledge Graph' to connect his scattered essays with GenAI tools.**
