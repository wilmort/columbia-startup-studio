## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Day-to-Day Routine

* **Structure:** Relatively chaotic; plans depend heavily on class schedule.
* **Free Time:** Hangs out with friends, cooks, reads, watches YouTube.
* **Key Locations:** Dining Hall, Map Lounge, Dodge Room (I-House).
* **Connection:** Feels more connected at I-House than on campus because the spaces are smaller and encourage natural "bumping into" people, unlike the large, impersonal libraries at Columbia.

### 2. Pain Points: Event Discovery

* **Information Overload:** Receives too many emails from different organizations.
* **Lack of Centralization:** No centralized view of events.
* **Categorization Issues:** Hard to distinguish between "Student Career Placement" activities and "Social" activities.
* **Consequence:** Often misses out on events he is actually interested in because he doesn't read every email.
* **Platform Preference:** Dislikes using Instagram for school events. Prefers Email or a Calendar format.

### 3. Social Needs & Wishlist

* **Desired Features:**
* **Low Barrier to Entry:** Informal and casual ways to meet people.
* **Automatic Matching:** A "hassle-free" system for things like lunch buddies that removes the need for back-and-forth texting.
