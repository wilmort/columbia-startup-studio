## What Did You Learn?

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Problem confirmed?** | **Y** (Struggles with procrastination, specifically during the "ideation stage") |
| **Key quote** | "Didn't like people seeing what he was doing [regarding productivity stats]." |
| **Emotional intensity** | **5/10** (Has a solid system in place, but admits to ideation struggles) |
| **Current solution** | **Excel** (Custom columns/rows for deadlines); **Stopwatch** (self-competition); "Soft deadlines." |
| **Money spent?** | **N** (Uses existing tools: Excel, Google Calendar). |
| **Surprise** | He uses a stopwatch to "compete with himself" rather than competing with others; explicitly rejected social accountability tools due to privacy. |

## Solution Reaction

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Their reaction** | **Negative to Social Accountability.** unlike Wanyi (Interview #2), Gideon hated sharing his stats. |
| **Key quote** | "Stopped because he didn't like people seeing what he was doing." |

| **Referral?** | N |

## Overall Signal

**Circle one:**

🟡 **YELLOW** — Mixed signal. He is a power user of his own system (Excel + Stopwatch) and has specific preferences (Privacy > Social). He might be a "hard sell" for a standard productivity app because he prioritizes the extreme customizability of Excel.

## One-Sentence Takeaway

*What's the single most important thing you learned from this interview?*

**Gideon proves that "gamification" doesn't always mean "social"—he wants to compete with himself (stopwatch) but demands total privacy from others.**
