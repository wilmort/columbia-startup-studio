Who did I talk to?
Jaren, Electrical Engineering in Canada
How did I find them?
Discord.
Problem Confirmed?
Yes.
Key Quote:
“Organization, logging all the info i’ve gathered, everything i’ve measured and all labeled. I want it to
read my upload better and enable other people to see the values better.”
Emotional intensity:
5, interested in the concept but less inclined to use it since as a student he must do all of the work by
hand.
Current solution:
Use available resources such as instructors and google to navigate running things that are foreign to
him.
Money Spent:
Whatever isn’t covered by his campus, so a lot.
Surprise:
The way data is shared collectively surprised me. He said “We pass on the project timely to avoid merge
conflicts. On other occasions we have programs that allow us to collaborate together, but you prefer
not to use that. I have my own logic on how circuits work and I can make changes whenever I want
without waiting for approval from another person and I don’t really need to explain myself. Since I’m
working with someone we will have different perspectives on the topic and this will help solve
problems you are limited to.”
Their reaction:
Very neutral to the concept (because I wasn’t able to show off the software itself).
Key quote:
“I would love to utilize it if it was able to combine all the niche engineering software I need or optimize
preexisting ones that crash often”.
Biggest concern:
Crashes while handling large data or doing very specific algorithms.
Referral?
No
Follow-up?
No
Pre-purchase?
No
Green Yellow or Red?
Yellow
One Sentence Takeaway
How niche do we want our project to be? We need to narrow down target audience because
accommodating some of this would make it inaccessible or unapproachable to casual data handlers.
