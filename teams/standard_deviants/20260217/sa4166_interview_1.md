Interview with Aeden, Humnan Rights major at Columbia, Analyst at Settlement Housing Fund

Speaker 1: OK, start. What is the issue that you or your boss or whoever was having? Where do you work, et cetera. Start with that.
Speaker 2: Okay... I work at Settlement Housing Fund. And well, my boss's boss is like the Director of Resident Engagement and Community Programs. A lot of her work is looking at the top-level information for how effective our programs are being. I guess one way they measure that is they think about how many evictions we’ve avoided and how much we’ve increased habitual rent pay.
She’ll look at all of the sites in our portfolio—particularly the ones owned by the company—and she'll look from the period of time when we started providing social services at that site up until the present day. For those households, she looks at the average level of arrears or how consistently folks are paying rent, and then she compares that with what it was like before we started providing social services.
Speaker 1: What form does this data live in on your computers?
Speaker 2: I mean, from what she shared with us when we took this recent report off of her hands, I think she just has loads and loads of spreadsheets. Just scattered. I imagine the workbooks on her end are more organized, but everything she shared with us has just been tables with a lot of rows.
Speaker 1: And is there no Excel program she’s written up to simplify the tasks?
Speaker 2: I don't have a sense of her Excel literacy, but for the report my coworker and I were tasked with writing, we were given access to data and a certain number of Excel sheets. At no point were we given guidance like, "You should use this tool on Excel." I can only assume they don’t have a streamlined system because I think they would have told us. One of the coordinators slightly above us—her guidance was basically about doing manual calculations.
Speaker 1: Manual?
Speaker 2: Yeah. When we were compiling the English and Spanish data together, I was the one who started using Excel to streamline that calculation process.
Speaker 1: But you would have to come up with your own functions to do that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you would say your main issue is that it’s super manual?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, definitely. That’s why it took ages. It’s super manual and there’s no organization-wide literacy. For example, this month, everyone in the organization got assigned a mandatory "Intro to Excel" training on LinkedIn Learning.
Speaker 1: Why do people in your office not use AI tools to help sort through the data? Is the data just super private?
Speaker 2: Honestly, my team is full of folks coming from a social service background. I don’t think there is an expectation that folks know how to manage or analyze data.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that’s the job, right?
Speaker 2: It ends up being an important part of the job for higher-level positions, but most folks on the team are not in those positions. I think somewhere along the way, for the folks that get to those management positions, they realize on their own they need X, Y, and Z skills—or maybe they get that when they get graduate degrees.
Speaker 1: Interesting. Do you know how the data is stored? Do you make changes to the data? Is that ever a problem?
Speaker 2: I know there have been problems in the past. We have these "master trackers" which are workbooks with multiple sheets. The first sheet lists all the tenants, their names, partner numbers, how much rent they owe, when their next benefit certification is, and how frequently they’re in contact. The other sheets are for more specific information. There are definitely problems; these sheets have comments that say, "Do not change this column without permission."
Speaker 1: So it's clear there have been issues where someone changed an Excel document.
Speaker 2: Yeah, changed it, made copies accidentally, or didn't know how to update it.
Speaker 1: Would an ability to see the history of your document be useful?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Back to the AI tools thing—since it’s such a manual job, why do you think nobody uses AI to help themselves?
Speaker 2: I think it’s intimidating for folks who don’t understand it. A lot of my coworkers find the concept of Excel scary. In their heads, they imagine it’s something you have to be a CS or Stats major to work with.
Speaker 1: But what about ChatGPT? Plain language?
Speaker 2: It’s not something we talk about as an organization. I don’t know if my coworkers use it. There’s a level of stigma. I wouldn’t say it’s an industry standard for nonprofits or social services to talk about how AI is useful. So much of our work is based on the idea that our labor comes from people interacting with other people. AI almost feels counter-intuitive to that.
Speaker 1: That makes sense. So your current solution is just manual checks. If there wasn't so much stigma, and there was a software that could save these teams hours, do you think the nonprofit would be willing to pay?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. There are certain things where it is normalized, like translation services that nonprofits move out-of-house and pay for because it streamlines things.
Speaker 1: Is the stigma around AI similar to the stigma that it uses too much energy?
Speaker 2: No, it’s more like the stigma in academic spaces—the idea that you’re using it to not do your work. You should be writing your case notes yourself; you shouldn’t have AI generating sentences for you.
Speaker 1: How does that extend to data analysis?
Speaker 2: People feel you can’t trust it or it won’t be precise. They worry it’ll hallucinate or make stuff up without the context of working in that space, like understanding the property or extenuating factors.
Speaker 1: If there was software that showed you exactly what it was doing to the data—every function and a mock-up of the result before executing—would that build trust?
Speaker 2: I think so, but that might introduce another barrier where the explanation itself becomes intimidating. I’ve had experiences explaining why I was calculating a median instead of a mean because of outliers, and that alone was enough to stir a reaction because they felt they were in territory that wasn't accessible for them.
Speaker 1: So what would a software need to handle for people to be comfortable?
Speaker 2: You need a way to access the explanation if you want it, but also a way to watch the process occur and get the result without a complex explanation being put in your face. It should be accessible, but not "in your face."
