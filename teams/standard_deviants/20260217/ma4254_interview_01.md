Introduction
○ My name is Jannatul and I’m a senior at Baruch. I’m studying cis with a concentration
in data analytics and minoring in cs.

● Do you often work with data collection/analysis tools? If so, which kinds?
○ Yes, often. Like I’m not taking classes or I didn’t do an internship. Literally python,
used r in my last internship, learning tableau. I don’t really use excel for the analysis
part but it’s used for the data part sometimes. And sql. I used big query last semester
● I notice you mentioned you had an internship last year, how have you handled data collection?
Could you walk me through some of the processes you had to do?
○ Girl, I had to make the data myself. What do you mean data collection? One dataset
was actually internal I think? The other one I had to literally record each accounting
statement and label its respective category into an excel sheet.

● How about analysis of that data?
○ Yeah I used R studio I think. I never used that before. I used plotly I think and
tidyverse.

● How did you find using those tools? Was there a learning curve or anything that you wish you
could change?
○ There was a learning curve but I used ChatGPT to help clarify a lot of the confusing
parts.

● Are there any steps where you find yourself switching between tools or doing manual work
you wish was automated?
○ Um no I was learning but lowkey half of it can be done through ai. I used ai more so
for what it's called- I forgot the word... like fixing errors.

● Can you walk me through what happens between collecting a response and having a "finding"
you'd write up?
○ Well you get your visualizations. And it depends on how you present it tbh, whether
it’s a pp or a dashboard or yk. Usually the point is to have visualizations be simple for

the stakeholders to understand, It shouldn’t be complex. But depending on how you
present you’ll have an explanation written as well.

● I see, could you maybe segment the entire process? I understand now what the goal of ur final
process is but im still a little unclear on what the steps you do on a higher level?
○ Oh the first step and most time consuming is data cleaning/processing. You get your
goals on what you want to learn from your data right? Like the questions? Then you
have your data which you might have to collect or it’s already given. You then clean and
process that data. Then you start answering the questions/goals and you analyze your
data. Maybe analyzing comes before cleaning, cause you have to look at your data and
understand it before you bloody clean. Then you analyze and visualize. After your
visualizations are set then you can present. \

● How do you share work-in-progress with collaborators or advisors? How do you guys handle
things like working at the same time without erasing other progress and other issues that may
arise from faulty GitHub commits and pushes/etc?
○ I didn’t use GitHub in my internship. I just sent my boss the html file, but it wasn’t a
group project. I’ve used Google colab, but never git for collaboration.

● What were some pain points in your workflow? Has a tool limitation ever affected the quality
or timeline of a project? And if you could fix one thing about how you do analysis today, what
would it be?
○ Oh I actually don’t have an answer to this. I don’t have enough experience to answer
that.

● Have you ever looked into dedicated tools for your analysis, beyond Excel or Google Sheets or
other tools you’ve used so far?
○ Well Google Sheets sucks, let’s start there, Excel is better than Google Sheets because it
has more features. I had to use Google Sheets once and I wanted to die. I literally
copied and pasted everything to excel just to do it.

● Was it unintuitive or just confusing in general? Are the commands worse in GS than Excel or
do you hate the layout?
○ The basic commands are similar, but after that it’s different. There are some
commands missing.

● What would make you switch from your current setup to something new? What would hold
you back?
○ Unemployment would hold me back from indulging in either. Also, I don’t use excel
too much tbh, I use python most I’d say, and I liked my R experience so maybe I’d
think about that.

● If excel wasn’t free to you right now, would you switch to Google Sheet?
○ I’d get a 9-5 that pays for it. (basically never pay out of pocket for it). I love it so much
I’d break the law to get it.
