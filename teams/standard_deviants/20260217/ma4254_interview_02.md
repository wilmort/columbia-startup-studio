● Introduction
○ My name is Jaren and I’m a second year student studying electrical engineering.
● Do you often work with data collection/analysis tools? If so, which kinds?
○ Really often, I use Oscilloscopes, multimeters to collect data regarding the voltage and
other data regarding electrical components.

● How have you handled data collection? Could you walk me through some of the processes you
had to do?
○ I typically write it on paper or put it in some type of notes. And then I transfer it to
excel.

● How about analysis of that data?
○ Just check if the input is working, check for positive voltage, and if the output is
working/going through the wire. We can also plot the data.

● Can you walk me through what happens between collecting a response and having a "finding"
you'd write up?
○ Measurement Procedure: Measure and record:Actual voltage across resistor and
Current flowing through resistor for example. Step 2: Organizing Data in Excel, Input
all values into Excel, Convert current from mA to A (unit consistency). Add calculated
columns. Step 3: Graphical Analysis: Create a scatter plot: X-axis: Voltage, Y-axis:
Current. Insert a linear trendline. Display equation on chart. Step 3 is done by hand.
Step 4: Error Analysis. After getting the values, we use it to make a graph, so using excel
is good in order to visually see changes in values to help graph. We draw the graph.
Even if it's not accurate, it's an estimation. We use software to emulate.

● How did you find using those tools? Was there a learning curve or anything that you wish you
could change?
○ I find excel pretty easily by playing around with it, as for other sites, the instructor
shows us on the board and the rest we just figure. We read through the websites with

help buttons which help us figure out what button/feature do and we need. Googling
and youtube videos help with quick explanations if the help insight is not enough.

● How often do you find yourself seeking extra help?
○ Not quite often, if I need help I seek my instructor for help.
● Are there any steps where you find yourself switching between tools or doing manual work
you wish was automated?
○ Yes, bc he;s forced to do stuff by hand. So he’d ideally use software to graph and etc etc.
● How do you share work-in-progress with collaborators or advisors? How do you guys handle
things like working at the same time without erasing other progress and other issues that may
arise from faulty GitHub commits and pushes/etc?
○ We are made to do separate parts, so after someone finishes designing it goes to the next
person to add wiring and so on. We pass on the project timely to avoid merge conflicts.
On other occasions we have programs that allow us to collaborate together, but you
prefer not to use that. I have my own logic on how circuits work and I can make
changes whenever I want without waiting for approval from another person and I
don’t really need to explain myself. Since I’m working with someone we will have
different perspectives on the topic and this will help solve problems you are limited to.
● What were some pain points in your workflow? Has a tool limitation ever affected the quality
or timeline of an assignment? And if you could fix one thing about how you do analysis today,
what would it be?
○ Painpoint: some machines where its not accurate measurement or data so those are
annoying. Workaround this by grabbing multiple components to try the circuit a
couple times and measure it together and see the average to get a closer data value.
○ Yeah, if we have complicated circuits the software has a tendency to crash.
○ Organization, logging all the info i’ve gathered, everything i’ve measured and all
labeled. I want it to read my upload better and enable other people to see the values
better. A smart structured excel sheet to adapt to the assignments needs.

● Have you ever looked into dedicated tools for your analysis, beyond Excel or Google Sheets or
other tools you’ve used so far?
○ Yes, I used Ciruit Design and simulation: Multisim, Eagle, Altium Designer
○ System Modeling and Control: MATLAB and Simulink, LabVIEW
○ Power Systems and Electrical Networks: ETAP, PSCAD
○ Embedded Systems and Microcontrollers: Arduino IDE, Proteus
○ Data Analysis and Visualization: Excel, Python, OriginLab
○ Specialized Tools: COMSOL Multiphysics
● What would make you switch from your current setup to something new? What would hold
you back?
○ Unless they make a software that has everything we analyzed I would never switch. You
would switch if there was a program that combined all this. Or if another program that
is better existed– easier to use and better output and optimized (makes a preexisting
process easier). Mainly crashes get to him.
