## Definitions:

### Problem Space

The problem space centers on the friction that arises when non-technical researchers perform data analysis using general-purpose tools (e.g., spreadsheets, statistical GUIs, downloaded CSVs) on personal laptops in collaborative office settings.

### Target Users

### Main Research Question

  

## Assumptions:

1. Users Do Not Want to Learn Programming

  

We assume:

• Most target users prefer low-code or no-code environments.

• Asking them to “just use Python” is not viable at scale.

  

⸻

  

2. Spreadsheet-Based Workflows Will Persist

  

Even if better tools exist, Excel/Sheets will remain dominant in many offices.

  

Any solution likely needs to:

• integrate with

• wrap around

• or augment

existing tools.

  

⸻

  

3. Reproducibility Is Valued but Underserved

  

We assume:

• Researchers care about defending and re-running their work.

• Current tooling does not sufficiently support this without technical skill.

  

⸻

  

4. Time Is Scarcer Than Compute

  

The constraint is not laptop performance.

It is:

• mental bandwidth

• process clarity

• workflow organization

  

⸻

  

5. Collaboration Is Increasingly Cross-Skill

  

Teams often include:

• nontechnical researchers

• technical analysts

• managers

  

Bridging these skill gaps is valuable.

  

⸻

  

6. Pain Is Chronic, Not Catastrophic

  

Most problems are:

• frequent

• low-grade

• compounding

  

Not dramatic failures — but daily friction.
