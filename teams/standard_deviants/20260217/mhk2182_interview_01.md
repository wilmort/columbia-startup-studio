## How Companies Use CRM & Analytics Tools

* Platforms like Salesforce act as central data aggregators, pulling together customer, subscription, and usage data.
* Organizations monitor key indicators (e.g., subscription drops) that trigger deeper investigation.
* The evolution:

  * Past: CRM = digital Rolodex
  * Present: behavioral intelligence platform that helps teams understand how customers think and act
* Value comes from:

  * Large plugin ecosystems
  * Custom internal extensions for company-specific needs

👉 Core job-to-be-done:

Help organizations understand their customers and their behavior.

## Salesforce vs. HubSpot

### Salesforce

Strengths

* Extremely powerful and customizable
* Massive integration ecosystem
* Industry standard for large enterprises

Weaknesses

* Very expensive
* Complex to implement fully
* Many companies buy only a minimal tier and supplement with cheaper tools

### HubSpot

* Seen as more analytics-friendly out of the box
* Often used as a lower-cost complement or alternative

👉 Insight:

Companies assemble tool stacks, not single solutions.

## AI & Internal Tooling

* Both platforms are integrating AI for predictive insights
* Companies frequently build internal plugins/tools to:

  * Meet compliance needs
  * Extract specific insights
  * Work around SaaS limitations
---

## Data Governance & Compliance Constraints

This is a major opportunity area:

* Sensitive data (PII/PHI) is often not allowed in SaaS platforms like Salesforce due to SOP and regulatory constraints.
* This creates demand for:

  * On-prem solutions
  * Certified cloud environments
* Clarity’s previous work sat in this space:

  * Making predictions
  * Connecting datasets
  * While remaining compliant

👉 Clear market gap:

Customer-understanding tools that work on regulated data.
