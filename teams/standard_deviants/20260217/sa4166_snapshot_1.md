**Interview Snapshot**

**Who:** Staff member/Researcher at Settlement Housing Fund (NYC Housing Non-Profit)

**Problem confirmed:** Yes. Significant manual labor, data fragmentation, and a lack of organizational data literacy are actively hindering reporting and program evaluation.

**Key quotes:**
- "My boss’s boss... she just has loads and loads of spreadsheets... just kind of scattered."
- "One of the coordinators... her guidance was about doing manual calculations, basically."
- "The concept of Excel is just scary to them... they think you have to be a CS or stats major."
- "AI almost feels counter-intuitive to [social services]."

**Emotional intensity:** High (7/8) regarding the tediousness of manual tasks and the intimidation factor of data; Moderate (4/8) regarding the cultural stigma and "cheating" perception of AI.

**Current solution:** Scattered Microsoft Excel workbooks ("Master Trackers"). Manual merging of datasets (e.g., English and Spanish data). No standardized functions or automation. "Security" is handled via protective cell comments (e.g., "Do not change this column"). No version control exists, leading to accidental copies and corrupted data.

**Money spent:** None on data software currently. However, they do pay for external services (like translation) that solve specific labor-intensive problems, suggesting a willingness to pay for tools that are "normalized" and streamline workflow without requiring new in-house expertise.

**Reaction + Commitments**

**Solution reaction:** The interviewee responded well to the idea of a tool that provides transparency without complexity. The "opt-in" explanation model (where logic is available but not "in your face") was identified as a way to bypass the intimidation barrier.

**Biggest concerns:**
1. Trust/Precision: Fear of "hallucinations" or AI missing the human context of the housing properties.
2. Accessibility: Anything that looks too much like "Code" or "Stats" will cause a defensive reaction from the social service-heavy team.
3. Stigma: The tool must not feel like it's "replacing" the human element or helping staff "avoid" their work.

**Surprises/Contradiction of assumptions:**
- The "Cheating" Narrative: Surprising that AI is viewed through an academic lens of "laziness" rather than just a utility.
- Excel as a Barrier: Even basic Excel is seen as a high-level technical skill, meaning the "solution" must look and feel simpler than a spreadsheet to be adopted.
- Manual as Standard: The fact that supervisors are explicitly teaching manual calculation as the primary method suggests a deep-rooted lack of technical infrastructure.
