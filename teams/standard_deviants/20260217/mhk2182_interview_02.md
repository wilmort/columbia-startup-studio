# # Interview 2 – Liz (Scimitar Consulting)

## Role & Context

Liz’s work centers on qualitative research, customer discovery, and pain-point identification, especially through interviews.

---

## Current Workflow for Customer Insight

1. Conduct customer interviews
2. Transcribe them
3. Analyze for:

   * Pain points
   * Patterns
   * Role-based differences

⠀
This process is:

* Time-intensive
* Manual
* Dependent on researcher skill
---

## Use of AI in Research

She already uses tools like ChatGPT to:

* Ingest interview transcripts
* Summarize findings
* Identify themes

But effectiveness depends heavily on:

* Prompt quality
* Providing sufficient context

👉 Insight:

AI is helpful but not yet structured for this workflow.

## Desired Capabilities in a New Tool

A valuable solution would:

* Understand the customer context automatically
* Generate:

  * High-quality summaries
  * Pain-point extraction
  * Thematic analysis
* Handle cross-role comparison

* (e.g., how executives vs. operators describe the same problem)
---

## Other Tools in the Stack

* Uses survey platforms (e.g., Mentimeter) alongside interviews
* Indicates a mixed-methods workflow:

  * Qualitative interviews
  * Quantitative surveys

# Cross-Interview Synthesis (What This Means for Your Startup)

## 1. Core Customer Need

Across both interviews:

> Organizations are trying to understand their customers, but current tools are fragmented, manual, and often non-compliant for sensitive data.

---

## 2. Clear Market Opportunities

### A. Qualitative Insight Platform

A tool that:

* Ingests interview transcripts
* Automatically extracts:

  * Pain points
  * Themes
  * Role differences
* Produces structured outputs

### B. Compliance-Friendly AI Analytics

Particularly for:

* Healthcare
* Finance
* Gov / enterprise

Key differentiator:

* Works with PII/PHI in secure environments
---

## 3. Positioning Guidance

From John’s explicit advice:

> Pick a niche and go deep.

Your wedge could be:

* “AI for customer interview analysis in regulated industries”

* or
* “Secure qualitative analytics for teams that can’t use SaaS CRMs for sensitive data”
---

## 4. Why Existing Tools Don’t Solve This

* CRMs = structured quantitative data, not interview insight
* ChatGPT = powerful but:

  * prompt-dependent
  * not workflow-aware
  * no persistent context
