### **Research Project Overview**

●      **Researcher is completing thesis on learning theory, proposing new "explore-establish-exploit" model to replace traditional explore-exploit framework**

●      **Research uses custom-built puzzle games to study knowledge acquisition and decision-making processes**

●      **Currently in second round of interviews for Applied AI Engineer Strategist internship, though compensation and Virginia relocation requirements are concerns**

●      **Mark (advisor) offered lab position pending grant approval, would pay more than internship offer**

●      **Thesis argument: explore-exploit model is outdated and doesn't account for real-time hypothesis testing that humans perform during learning**

### **Data Collection Process**

●      **Collecting multiple data types: eye tracking, verbal reasoning traces, game state data, full key logging, timestamps, and survey data**

●      **Survey includes questions about puzzle/video game enjoyment (Likert scale), autism, ADHD, Parkinson's disease, and spatial navigation issues**

●      **Training two research assistants (Clarissa and Blair) to conduct data collection consistently**

●      **Had to exclude 11 participants from previous analysis due to inconsistent data collection methods**

●      **Recruited 225 participants through flyers and Reddit posts**

●      **Uses detailed participant tracker in Excel to coordinate scheduling and track progress**

●      **Recently implemented PID system (participant ID) for better file organization**

### **Technical Workflow & Tools**

●      **Built custom puzzle games from scratch using JavaScript, which took about 4 months to get pilot testing running**

●      **Uses VS Code as primary IDE, Claude for code generation in terminal**

●      **Manually reviews every line of AI-generated code to understand it, especially important since JavaScript was self-taught**

●      **Transcription process has issues - some audio transcribed in Korean, needs to be redone before paper submission**

●      **Built custom NLP program using multi-pass processing for feature extraction, improved accuracy from 4% to 56%**

●      **NLP program categorizes speech into explore, establish, or exploit phases using keyword matching, contextual checks, and temporal weighting**

●      **Uses weighted attention-like mechanism - higher weight for exploration at beginning of levels, exploitation near end**

●      **Program generates manual review files showing patterns across game levels**

### **Data Analysis Challenges**

●      **Initially tried K-means clustering on movement data but discovered it was meaningless - just showed where restricted movement areas were in the game**

●      **Met with multiple professors (four total) to determine appropriate statistical methods**

●      **Uses mixed effects linear regression modeling to analyze relationship between puzzle/video game enjoyment and performance**

●      **For analysis tools: matplotlib, scikit-learn, stats models, some pandas**

●      **Considered using R for BIC and AIC analysis (easier than Python) but ultimately didn't need it**

●      **Planning to use dynamic programming algorithms (Baum-Welch or Viterbi) to analyze transitions between learning stages**

●      **Statistical reasoning is not intuitive - needs to see data visualizations to understand if analysis is meaningful**

●      **Finding what information is meaningful in the data requires significant effort and consultation**

### **Organization & Workflow Improvements**

●      **Major organizational challenge: initially had research assistants save files in separate Google Drive folders for remote work**

●      **Recently implemented systematic file naming convention (PXXX-GA/GB/GC-type) that allows seamless code integration**

●      **Better organization from the start would have saved significant time**

●      **Uses extensive Excel tracking for participant management and coordination**

### **Product Demo & Feedback**

●      **Anuraag revealed his class project: data analysis tool that automates cleaning, regression analysis, and provides AI insights**

●      **Tool features automated buttons for data cleaning, correlation analysis, and various regression types**

●      **Provides AI-generated interpretations of statistical results at bottom of analysis**

●      **Currently supports CSV files with plans to expand**

●      **Researcher enthusiastically interested in using the tool, willing to pay $10/month**

●      **Key feedback: needs multiple visualization options (histograms, violin plots, etc.) for same analysis**

●      **Researcher emphasized importance of visualizations for understanding data and identifying meaningless results**

●      **Currently spends more than $10/month on Claude, so pricing seems reasonable**

### **Key Insights on Research Pain Points**

●      **Data collection is most annoying part of process, but necessary**

●      **Most time-consuming aspect: going through AI-generated code, understanding it, and manually modifying it**

●      **Statistical reasoning requires significant mental effort - not intuitive for researcher**

●      **Motivation lower for data analysis compared to game development**

●      **Would prefer to outsource data analysis if not for thesis requirement**

●      **Researcher's psychologist mentioned hiring someone for PhD data analysis is common practice**

●      **Visual learning style means trends aren't apparent until seeing visualizations**

**Notes**

**Transcript**

**What about now? Can you hear me now? Yes, now I can. Cool, cool, cool. So how are you?**

**I'm good.**

**I'm tired. Yeah, me too. How's stuff going? How are things going? Oh.**

**Good. I'm into the second round of an interview for a Tech internship.**

**Good luck. You wanna do tech? You wanna like coding type? No.**

**Well, not no, but Mark thinks it's good for my resume.**

**It's like an AI...**

**Applied AI Engineer Strategist Goal.**

**Oh. Dude, good luck.**

**Yeah, they're trying to pay me like dog shit.**

**Yeah, they do do that.**

**Let's see if I can... Get paid a living wage. And they also want me to relocate to Virginia.**

**It's only for the summer or for full time?**

**No, only for a year.**

**Oh, damn. Yeah. Damn. A year? Like, like, uh... Wait, you're a junior, senior?**

**No, I'm graduating.**

**You're graduating, right? Wait, so it'll be for a year and then... And then what would your plans be? You want to come back or like you're done with this or what?**

**Oh, no. I mean, Mark offered me a job at the lab, but his We didn't hear back about a grant. So I mean Surprisingly, he'd be paying more than this company. But we'll see. I just need something to do in the year while I'm doing my PhD applications. Fair.**

**Yeah, this should probably help too. Okay, so talk to me about some of the research that you do, what your process looks like.**

**Wait, this is for your study?**

**Yeah, this is for my class, yeah.**

**Oh, okay. Um, Okay. Where do...**

**I mean, I am generally curious too since it has been a while since we talked. But yeah, continue.**

**I'm trying to think where I start with this. I mean, right now I'm doing human data collection and I'm training... If you saw Clarissa in the meetings, she's one of my research assistants. And then Blair, who hasn't been in the meetings but will probably come at some point, is also another one of my research assistants. And so... Yeah, I just, I have to train them to do data collection in the exact way I would do it because I had these people do it over break.**

**and I did not like how they did it. I had to exclude 11 people from my analysis. Um Mark says that an important part is learning how to delegate.**

**So wait, so what did that process look like when you say data collection? Like what types of data are you collecting? How does that look?**

**I'm collecting eye tracking data. recordings of verbal reasoning traces, like in the form of like verbal explanations. I'm collecting Game of State data, timestamps for all movements, full key logging of movements in my puzzles, and also survey data, like demographic survey data, although it's anonymous, but asking people about like... if they like puzzles or Sudoku on a Likert scale or if they like video games or also if they're diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, fun stuff like that.**

**I see. No one said yes to Parkinson's. I just feel like I have to put it on there. More generally, I'm looking to see if anyone who plays my, solves my puzzles has a spatial or navigation issues.**

**Right, right, right.**

**I also look for, look at autism and ADHD and stuff like that. All the autistic people are going to solve it better, but like off the record. I haven't proven that yet.**

**After you get the data, what does the process look like?**

**So right now I, Okay, soRight, that's a great question. Right now, my preliminary analysis was mostly just like mixed effects, linear regression modeling. And I made like a skeleton of a program with Claude. And then I modified it to fit exactly what I need. That being said, I'm going to use some dynamic programming. And so I have a meeting on Wednesday with Professor Bauer, if you know him, the NLP guy.**

**But also for this, I built my own NLP program. That took a long time. Good Lord. But so basically what I do for my, the audio recordings of participants who are like explaining how they're solving the games in real time, I, I, first take the audio and run it through a really crappy transcription program that I wrote that I have to redo because some of it... transcribed it in Korean. So I had to fix that.**

**Some of it worked. I got a friend to help with the last one, but I'm really going to have to fix this before the paper, before it's time to write. And then I built this NLP program that uses multi-pass processing to look at, basically just to do feature extraction, but sorting participants' explanations into three main categories.**

**Yes, I look you forgot. You're not right. No. So you just like pick this stuff up on the fly? Yeah. How was that?**

**Um, I mean, it was hard, but it was fine. I'm now, Mark has me in... the ai class comms 44071 and i'm like really struggling a lot but i i'm at this point where like i really think i can do anything i just don't think i can do everything well but i do think i can give everything a genuine and honest attempt if i try my absolute hardest i see so like very The data analysis and stuff that you're doing, you're using pandas and...**

**I used a little bit of pandas. I mean, for modeling, I used matplotlib and scikit and... Stats models.**

**I see. So that's something where, so like, just so I understand your workflow, what's happening is like, do you use Excel at all by the way, or?**

**Yes, I use so much Excel. Okay. And like literally so much. So I mean, theThe flow starts here actually, if you want me to really take you through the flow.**

**Take me through the flow, that would be awesome.**

**I mean, the beginning of the flow was that I built all of this from scratch and it took like four months to actually get, you know, pilot testing up and running. But where I'm at now is I'm able to share my screen. Oh, yeah, I see it. Okay. So basically a participant, I'll take you from the start to finish.**

**Yes, please. That would be awesome. I can't see your screen, Loki.**

**Oh, I didn't share that. I'm just navigating. Okay. Is this the share? Share window? Open system settings. Oh crap, sorry. No, you're good. Queens. Okay, how do I do this? I don't like Google me. I mean, I guess it's better actually than Teams.**

**Teams is disgusting. Don't even talk to me about Teams.**

**For this interview I had last week, I was like 15 minutes late because it kept making me create a new Teams account. It was so bad. And I had to apologize. I was just like, I'm so sorry. Like, no, quit and reopen. Yeah. Sorry. You're like completely quit and reopen. Okay. So I have these flyers around school. I've also put them on Reddit. And I've got a lot of people from Reddit.**

**Wait, I don't think he can still not see your screen.**

**No, no, no. I haven't shared it yet.**

**Oh, okay, okay, okay.**

**Now I've just opened it and now I'm able to share it.**

**Understood, understood, understood. Got it, got it, got it, got it.**

**I was just giving you like background.**

**Yeah, yeah, sorry. I'm getting excited. Okay, continue. So we have these flyers. We're putting them on Reddit.**

**And you see my screen now.**

**Yeah. Yes. Awesome. Okay, cool.**

**So People start by filling out An interest form. which looks like this. We've had 225 responses. Oh, got a new person today. Damn. And Yeah, so they filled this interest form, give me their name and their email. That's that. Then... I have, this thing's a little annoying, but I have a participant tracker, but it takes a lot. So when you're saying, do you use Excel? Absolutely, I use Excel. So every single person that puts their name in and their email, I also have to coordinate because I have two research assistants that work for me.**

**And so how do I get this thing to move?**

**On the scroll bar on the bottom. Uh, uh...**

**Okay, thanks. Cool. Got it. There we go. So yeah, I manually email them with their name because I want it to feel like more personal. I haven't emailed everyone as you can see. I'm still getting through them. But these people are just from like, some are from like December 6th. Sorry, no, February 6th. So it's kind of recent. And I have people that opted out, some for ethical reasons and some people just no response.**

**So yeah. Um, Then, scheduling. I schedule them, and I have, depending on, I have Clarissa and Blair, and... And now a new thing is I'm using a PID system or participant ID because I had the weirdest organization last time. Maria helped me by making this shell script, which like saves all the files in the right place when I really could have just been using like a code system the whole time.**

**Say that again.**

**like I could have named the files in a way where I wouldn't, I could just put them all in a file and like, And this is what I'm doing now. So basically, it says each file is named PXXX. There's three numbers, assuming there's no more than three digits of participants. And so it's P, let's say like 032 is the 32nd participant. Then it says game A or GA. And then it says versus game B or game C, which are just denoting the puzzles.**

**And then it's whether it's eye tracking, the audio recording, or the game state data. I can show you what that looks like. The game state data is my favorite one. So yeah, anyways, I do the actual assessment and then I get from the assessment, I can show you what some data looks like. The audio is like a recording. The game states are my favorite. I think they're just like, they look really fun. So this is for puzzle A.**

**You get background cell and I have like a little key and then it tells me the delta of like where they moved at each second and it has, I like just recreated the grid in an array.**

**It's kinda cute.**

**because it's like a little six by six grid in the game. So yeah, super cute. Very readable. I like that. The eye tracking is... Very simple. I don't really care about the eye tracking that much. Mark is more interested in this, but it does tell you exactly I don't know if there's like a confidence interval, but it does tell you exactly which block someone's like looking at at a time. Right. I'm not sure how accurate this is.**

**And sometimes it says null, so I don't know. Maybe they look away. Um, Eye tracking is not my thing, so I'm not really an expert in that. I feel like it's too complicated. Like it's just, there's a lot of eye tracking research in neuroscience and it's like really robust and thorough and knowing that I'm like kind of like MacGyvering this. I shouldn't be trusted with eye tracking, but that's okay. So then I download the data.**

**First, I run the speech record. I mean, it's not a speech. It's just a recording. Like, it literally is like... audio recordings like this run it through transcription to get um a transcription program to transcribe it and then i put it through this nlp program let me see if i can share this one And this, how do I stop presenting? Oh my God. Sorry. Okay. and NLP program. I wrote, which, so it uses multi-pass processing, but I'm still, it started at like a 4% accuracy and I'm still working on it.**

**I got it up to 56%, which I feel like is a lot. For me, that's very exciting.**

**I'm a little confused. What is it? It takes their audio data and just transcribes it.**

**No, no, that's a transcript. That's a separate transcript.**

**Oh, oh, oh.**

**That's just like a regular transcription program. I'm using feature extraction to sort sequences of speech into certain categories. This is what I'm doing for my paper, which is I'm proposing a new theory of learning. Spoiler. So in Instead of explore-exploit, I'm arguing that the explore-exploit model is outdated and does not fit the robustness and richness of human cognition and that in humans, when we're actually...**

**learning like a better, more analogous model would be explore, establish, exploit. And so I'm sorting everything into those three I guess little bins. Well, excluding certain things that are like RA data, but I have something actually I troubleshooted last week. I'll tell you that in a sec. Um Wait, let me go to my program. Okay, I can't find it. I'm just going to tell you about it. So I run it through this NLP program that sorts it into explore, establish, or exploit.**

**And then it flags the ones that it's not sure about for manual review. The point system, I guess, that it's using for the feature extraction is it gives it a point if it immediately thinks using keywords and phrases. For example, if it says curious, if the word is curious, that I put in there into my program, look for curious, it'll say, okay, curious is one point towards exploration. Like if someone says curious and then, but it wasn't very accurate despite this.**

**So I added multi-pass processing using temporal and sequential checks or temporal and contextual checks. Okay.**

**This is a program that you built to, convert your audio to convert your transcription To like a data table, right?**

**Yes. I see.**

**Okay, that makes sense.**

**Yeah, because it took me a while to figure out what would work for this. And K-means clustering is not valuable here. It doesn't mean anything with my data of movements or speech. But so it took me a while meeting with different researchers and people from other universities trying to figure out what is the best type of analysis for this. And it looks like... like NLP feature extraction and dynamic programming are the most relevant besides, you know, like just regression modeling, but that's like standard.**

**What do you mean by dynamic programming?**

**So like Baum-Welch algorithm or like Viterbi algorithm, I really can't tell you much about it because I don't know it yet, but it's a way to explore even Markov models. And I'm in, you know, like, data and stuff and I'm going to specifically look at it to use I would use the look at sequences of knowledge acquisition and basically support the fact that there is an established phase coming between explore and exploit.**

**I would use Baumwalsch to look at like the transitions between stages, but I have a meeting on Wednesday with Professor Bauer. So I'm not, that's like, currently where I'm at. So I can't give you any more information, unfortunately. Um So yeah, I'm going to use dynamic programming algorithms. to be determined which one to basically or I guess support these, categories of knowledge acquisition. that I've found.**

**And I found them through something called grounded theory analysis, which is like you start from like behavioral observation, which is exactly what happened. And also there's like a ton of research to support that people do incorporate real-time hypothesis testing in decision-making. It's like, duh, it's like so obvious, but it's so obvious, but like... It's generally not accounted for in a computational model.**

**There's like, it's not a separate thing.**

**I see.**

**or hypothesis testing. It's just all clustered together.**

**Wait, say that one more time.**

**Say that one last time. Oh, I was saying that, um, Uh. Oh, decision hypothesis testing and decision making and trial and error are not, from what I've encountered, not generally accounted for in computational models of knowledge acquisition and learning. But we know that humans do this. And it seems very obvious. So that kind of goes back to my main argument, which is that why explore, exploit itself.**

**It's so foundational, but it's also just a little outdated. ill-fitting. Okay.**

**So, yeah. Cool. What would you do with, can you talk to me about like some of the stuff you do with your aggressions and like the types of the like data that you manipulate look at and perform aggressions on? Yes.**

**One interesting thing I found was, so I mentioned to you that I asked people, in survey data to rate how much they enjoy puzzles versus video games on separate Likert scales. I say puzzles like Crosswords or Sudoku is the example, those are the examples I give. And then also, I think I just said video games.**

**I'm like, that's just, you have to know what that is. If you don't, like, I don't know why you're here. No, I'm just kidding. Don't include that. But...**

**So I used a Mixed effects linear regression modeling to see if the rating that you gave for how much you enjoy video games versus puzzles could predict your performance.**

**I see.**

**I assess performance in... For this, I'm just doing like a rank order With regard to Speed. But I'm, 'cause my, generally my experiments are time independent, so it doesn't, Like, I don't, it's just for this purpose. I don't really view that as like a failure if you go slow. Like everyone solves it, who I'm evaluating. I do have people that don't solve it, but I'm not including them for this. this analysis because it's very few people.**

**Okay, so when you get your, when you have your survey data, I imagine you have it in some sort of CSV.**

**Yes. Actually, no, it's an Excel file.**

**It's an Excel file. Okay. So... If you could, like, if you have it available, like, if you could just, like, walk me through what your process of, like, utilizing Excel was over time when you were, like, trying to hypothesize, like, what should I do the linear regression on? Like, what should I, you know... Is that something that you have available to you right now? And if not, you can just like talk me through it.**

**I'm trying to think if that's... even visible because it was very much like a Like I made a whole, I first made a whole program for like K-means clustering. And then I was like, I met with a professor and he was like, yeah, this is like, this means nothing.**

**And I was like, it's not. Okay.**

**So you coded to...**

**I've made so many little different programs that I'm not using anymore. I guess I'll put it like that. Let me look for my...**

**So what does your process look like for those programs? Like you're prompting GPT and then you're copy pasting it into your IDE or maybe you have cursor or something going and then you're just running it?**

**Um, so I'm... That's a great question. I am prompting Claude code in my terminal. And then I am using VS code generally because I liked it. I already had so much stuff from classes in there, and I didn't want to switch to a new thing. But, and then I'm actually like manually look through it. And I don't know, at least for me, just my process, because I'm, I'm so new to this is I, I, like go and look at every line to understand it.**

**In Python, it's not a huge deal for me because I know Python, but the games were all coded in JavaScript.**

**And I didn't know that.**

**I see.**

**So I did have to teach myself that first. It wasn't too difficult because it's not actually that different from Python.**

**Yeah. So what parts are you spending the most time on and like what parts are the most annoying for you? Mmm.**

**That's a good question.**

**The parts that are most annoying is actual data collection. Okay.**

**I mean, I can't do it without data, without that, but I--Okay.**

**would prefer to not do it at all.**

**I was like, hey, I mean, it's going well, it seems.**

**It is, but like I can't ask my research assistants to do it all for me and not do anything for me, so. Okay, so after the data has been collected, now what part of the process is like the most annoying or like, the most time consuming or just like, you're like, ah, Um, If any. It's going to be painstaking going through it, understanding it, and manually modifying it.**

**Would you be able to show me what your program for like the linear regression one looked like or something like that?**

**Yeah, let me see. I can, sorry, it was...**

**doing an assignment for this class. So I'm like in VS Code, but...**

**Like how to make portal the game. Anyways. Okay.**

**Oh, damn. You gotta get on dark mode.**

**No, I literally turned it on. Sorry. I'm crazy.**

**Sorry to hear that. Yeah.**

**I love light mode. I like brightness. Let's see. Actually, I have no idea where I put this.**

**Oh, these are some old ones. No, there's nothing in there. I lied, go back. I'm looking for, nope. Nope. It's another thing too is like, The organization for this has been, oh, I know where it is. It's right here. Bye. Like I'm learning how to better organize as I go along, which is something. that I've Yeah, no, it's been a huge learning experience. Here's the Baumwelsch algorithm. You can see that this using, I researched this before I did it.**

**So actually, again, I'm not using this, but to ask... Before I gave Claude any instructions, I first researched what should be used. And I found out there was already a Python library called Learn. And I was like, great. And then I read their website. And then I asked, you know, it's like not... It's not that long. It's like 300 lines. So yeah. Yes. So going to my... NLP program, I'll tell you which stuff, I can show you some stuff I did manually that I'm proud of.**

**Can you, you can see my screen, right?**

**Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool. Um, Oh, there we go.**

**So Yeah, this was a little bit longer, but yeah. basically I'm having it. I mean, like I said, looking for certain words. Oh, the context. That's what I wanted to tell you. So I had the idea after making the first one to try to encode context evaluation, which isn't really like a thing, I guess. So I kind of just made it up as I go along. And so I, It basically looks at each line by line, like line by line in the audio transcript and it evaluates that based on the previous line and the line after it, because I told it before that First, I told this to Claude, but then I went and I worked out the actual code.**

**It doesn't... it like evaluates those and weight gives it higher weight to match those contexts. Does that make sense? So if it's like, it's not an actually, Oh, this, you should see this.**

**You should see.**

**It's kind of like attention. Yes.**

**I also do have like, it's weighted more highly for exploration towards the beginning of the first and second levels, but it's weighted obviously more highly for exploitation right before you solve the game. Like it seems very, like it makes sense. Also temporal context, it now takes the game state data and the timestamps and looks at where in the game did that thing or, you know, did that speech occur?**

**As if it's same thing, towards the beginning or the end, then it's likely one more than the other. I want to show you this because it's a really good visual. This is like actual, like partially analyzed data. This, but basically it's like it shows you what I've found. Okay, hold on.**

**There we go.**

**Yeah, so I have it, it generates this manual review needed thing. And so I've been going through it. And I manually mark whether it's explore, establish or exploit or unrelated. We're trying to limit in I didn't do all of these. So it's, I'm trying to limit our speed, like research assistant speech at all, is why I need training. But it's interesting, because you can see there's like kind of a pattern, where obviously every level, this is the first level is of the first game, it's going to start out as explore, And there's little like bouts of establish and then it's going to go back to explore.**

**But you'll never have explore to exploit. It's always explore, establish, exploit. So yeah, anyways, this is one that needs manual review because I have to rerun it to the NLP program. But you can see there's more often than not, my argument here is that in lieu of instructions, without instructions at all, once you've already explored, it's less about... Exploration more about hypothesis testing.**

**That makes sense to me.**

**Yeah, so I like that you can always see, You can see the gradient.**

**Yes.**

**Wait, this makes a lot of sense to me. Okay, quick question. Could you show me your I saw you had like a data analysis folder, like what's in there?**

**Oh, this one. Wait.**

**Oh, I mean, it might just be like random notes on things.**

**Yeah, no, it's these are random notes on things.**

**What about the like data programs? Is that anything like interesting? I'm just really curious what your programs look like for the actual analysis part.**

**No, these are all tutorials on how I make different ones and use different ones.**

**I see.**

**Truly, I'm... Like literally just... brute forcing this.**

**What does your R file look like? I noticed you had like an R file in your... Big, your big game study, game study folder, NBS code.**

**Oh, thanks. Yeah. Yes. I originally was going to use R, but there's, I don't know that there's anything in it. I decided not to. And I would have preferred not to anyways, but why would you prefer not to? So there was like one particular analysis. I'm trying to go back here that. that I thought I might need to do. And I found out that it's, from researching, apparently it's like much easier to do it in R than it is in Python.**

**I don't know why. I'm really not sure why. Oh yeah, it was BIC and AIC, like for stats. Yeah, yeah, yeah, makes sense. And because there's something, there was a library, which one of these that like you, they don't have, you could get in Python, but it's like, a bunch of extra steps and it's built into R, but I'm not using this anymore. So this is what.**

**Cool, makes sense. What about data** [](http://analysis.py)[**analysis.py**](http://analysis.py)**? I don't know what's in there.**

**I'll see if it says arc, but arc inspired. This is actually what I used for, I am using this. And the data viz is for my visualization. But to generate, this is what I said I'm using like, map plot lib and like stats models and stuff.**

**I see.**

**So how long did this take to spin up and... I guess what was the most annoying part about that?**

**Um,The most annoying part was trying to, for me, I'm just not like really a stats person. So figuring out what I needed to do, what kind of evaluation I needed for these, honestly, for this one, like I went through it, but I really didn't change like barely anything because this isn't like, this isn't the part of the study I care about. Well, no, like you need results. Obviously you need results. in your research, of course.**

**and like a strong analysis, but I wasn't too concerned about this one just because it's not really, it's not my thing.**

**Wait, I have a question. If you could like snap your fingers. Okay. And, um, change any part of this process? Like maybe something becomes like, like you can snap your fingers and it just happens automatically besides the data collection part. That would be awesome. Like what part of the process would you change? Hmm.**

**That's a good question. Sorry, one second, thank you.**

**I would have better organized my two things. I think I would better organize myself from the beginning. Like I'm using now this like file naming system where everything just runs through seamlessly with my code. I can all keep it in like one large folder. And in the beginning I wasn't doing that. I was like having my research assistants like put it in like separate like you Google Drive folders because they could do it remotely.**

**But now it's like if you It's really just like a simple organization thing would have made my life so much easier. So that, I mean, I just started doing that last week. Also,Yeah, I guess just like having, it would have definitely saved me time to have some of these programs written. Um... I mean, the games are novel, so I... There isn't really anything that could have been done. Like I had to program them and I still asked, uh, Thank you.**

**I still asked Claude for, let me just put this on do not serve, sorry.**

**Actually a participant.**

**I asked Claude for like a skeleton, but it took the games just because I poured my heart and soul into them.**

**It took a lot more work and a lot more attention to detail.**

**Um I think if I could change anything, it would be have someone else do my data analysis.**

**Oh, why? But not...**

**Well, I'm not really good at stats. So, I mean, it's not that I just, it's not like, I'm not, I guess I'm not bad at it. It's just, I really requires a lot of thinking.**

**Can you tell me about that?**

**Like, okay.**

**I, I, Finding out why K-means clustering doesn't do anything was a thing that like I knew what K-means clustering was. I knew what my data was, but until I saw the results. I was like, oh... Like, obviously. Let me explain. So I did K-means clustering specifically of movements on, like, the game board. And then I... And lo and behold, as you would expect, they looked exactly like where people were moving most on the game board.**

**The problem with this is that in game B in particular, I restrict movement on the game board. So you can only go into certain areas and have to solve the puzzle to move to certain other areas. Obviously people are going to be, if everyone's playing the same game, they're obviously going to be in the same area. And so like physically on the board. And I just, it, for some reason, it just, knew this information beforehand, it wasn't until I actually did the analysis, I was like, oh, this is crap.**

**I see. I was-When you say doing the analysis, you mean you wrote the program and you got the result and you looked at the result and you're like, oh, this is like, this is not.**

**I mean, I said I thought that it would be like that, but I also then met with a stats professor to go over it and to talk about like what is more interesting or what's more meaningful from this data. And that was super, super helpful, which is because it's it's. It's not as interesting like, I mean I guess some descriptive statistics are very interesting I think at a baseline, but in terms of like modeling, k-means clustering was just not useful at all for me.**

**But like looking at on average how many you know like like there's just descriptive stats how many uh moves does it take for people to beat game a versus game c or something like that like that's interesting and can tell you something about uh it can tell you some kind of you can infer that people are in some ways uh it actually takes a lot longer for game c it's the hardest one but in some ways there's something going on where people find game a easier for whatever reason i actually know the reason this game a doesn't require spatial reasoning but anyways um But, um...**

**the What was I going to say? Sorry, it's like late. My brain's going out. No, you're good.**

**Wait, you said...**

**I don't remember the question, I'm so sorry.**

**Just like, wait, you're good. So, I mean, I think for the most part, what you said makes sense. So now I'll drop theOh, this is something...**

**Wait, sorry. This is something that I had trouble... Finding out what information is meaningful from this is very... I and like in quantifying it, because I know qualitatively what's interesting. I know it's interesting how people are learning differently and especially how this diverges from machines and artificial intelligence attempting to solve the same games. We're not quite there yet.**

**We're not fine tuning this semester, but when I get there.**

**But how does that look in terms of data? And that, to me, that was really... I don't know. It was very hard to conceptualize.**

**Once you have the data, extracting information from the data you have, or... Knowing what questions to ask.**

**I can tell you, oh, the maximum amount of movements is 2,327. Like, what's interesting about that? Finding, making meaning of it was like a really, It took me a while. That was not intuitive. I literally had to meet four different professors. I think it's interesting. but it doesn't come naturally to me. Like, I guess... And seeing, well, do you think you can, this one professor said, do you think speech patterns can predict the movements that someone would make or vice versa?**

**You could do it the other way. Can movements predict the speech pattern occurring at the same time? But someone had to tell me that for me to be like, oh, that's interesting.**

**So what do you think would help you like? I guess if... What are your thoughts on... If those, if like random trends that were like in your data were just displayed to Maybe like, let's say like in your data, there are like a few trends that you can uncover by like hypothesizing, oh, I think this and this might interact in X way and then make a model and try to see if that's true. So if you had something that identified some of those trends in advance and showed them to you, as candidates for things that might be interesting, Like, what would that look like?**

**Would you think that would be helpful for you? Like, what, what would that would that benefit you at all? Is that kind of what you're saying?**

**Yeah, I guess I'm a visual person. And so it like it wasn't until I got to the visual stage, like actually looking at data visualization that I was like, oh, yeah. this is starting to mean something or rather showing me that I don't understand what it means. I see. Like it's me seeing it to understand, to realize I didn't understand.**

**And why don't you outsource the data analysis?**

**Because it's my thesis.**

**Oh, okay. But if it wasn't, you would?**

**Oh yeah. Absolutely.**

**Oh, why? I don't find it enjoyable. Why?**

**Like, why don't you like it? Really just 'cause it's hard.**

**It's not hard for me. Like what part about it is hard though?**

**Like it's not intuitive for me as I play and thinking about I guess statistical reasoning for me is not intuitive. I mean, it's not that it's impossible. It's just, you know, like... I know I can do hard things, you were saying, but if you're asking, like, why wouldn't I do it just because it takes more mental effort from me?**

**Makes sense. So it's more the statistical reasoning side and less of the fact that you have to sit and learn how to code all of this stuff, too. Or is it a little bit of both? Or like, what is it? A little bit.**

**Sorry. Yeah. A little bit of both. I mean, I was very motivated on learning how to code for the games. Like I remember I was doing like HTML tutorials and stuff, which I used to like mess around with HTML when I was a kid and I had Tumblr. So it was very much felt nostalgic. Yeah. But, uh... Yeah, for the data analysis, that motivation isn't quite there because, I mean, frankly, just like a lot more math.**

**And I'm not bad at math. I just don't enjoy it.**

**Makes sense. Okay. Yeah. Cool. Um, Now I'll drop the curtain and tell you all this is about. So, um... Basically, I'm in this class called like AI assisted development, like some startup studio. I think it's like something like this. Um, And... One of the problems that I was really interested in exploring is what the process of data analysis actually looks like for researchers. And if they're things that could make that actually a lot smoother, nicer and faster.**

**So... I one of my team members Made this little app here And... Oh, it's really jank. I have a bunch of these... dummy projects here. Let's see if it'll load. And basically what it does is you just click new project, you upload your data set and it has like automated buttons. You can click to automatically clean your data, sort your data and automatically run like certain regressions without you having to actually code it.**

**And then at the bottom, it has like a little AI insight about what the regression actually means.**

**So like, so cool. Yeah.**

**It's like, it's like kind of cool. Um, Let me see if I have any saved. Let me see if I can show you the correlate one.**

**So this has already been made or you're still making it?**

**It's right in front of me. It's pretty shit right now, but like...**

**No, like I for sure plan to outsource my data analysis in the future. I know I was talking to my therapist or my psychologist, I told her I was doing my own data analysis. She was like, why? When I did my PhD, I just hired someone for that. Like, you can just do that?**

**But...**

**So like... Yeah, okay, so like... So here's one example I have. Bye. All right, can you see my turn to share my screen? Can you see this? Yes. So I made a bunch of dummy ones here, but you basically come in, you just type in your project name and then you choose like a data file. Right now we only support like CSVs, but I already did this beforehand. After that, you have these little options to clean and quick clean your data.**

**It'll remove white space, any null values. We're thinking of some cool stuff to add here maybe. But some of the really cool stuff is that you can kind of just... Come in here And...**

**Oh my gosh, wait, there's a correlate button. Oh, I love that.**

**And a regression button.**

**It's pretty hype. Yeah, and you can come in here and just literally click the rows that you're interested in.**

**I'm using Spearman's rank for mine. This is so great.**

**You'd compute it and it will tell you what the correlations are between your tables. Then it could tell you how to interpret the correlations. Right now it's nothing like... Right now, it's just giving you, like, the basic stats knowledge, but we're thinking, like, if we could give some context to the thing that generates this, then it could tell you stuff about your data as well.**

**Absolutely, yeah.**

**Yeah, it's like cross-tab analysis. Maybe you have this and this. We'll give you some, like, give you some analysis. Nothing really interesting here, but... It'll give you like a little analysis at the bottom. And the idea is it's just supposed to be like a really easy way to preliminarily I don't think there's going to be any correlation here. It might not even run, honestly. Let's see. I've actually never used this one before but there's This is like a specific logistic type regression that we have as our default.**

**But like the idea is you can just type of like ordinal logistic regression or like which one?**

**Um, Honestly, I'm not sure, but I don't even know what ordinal logistic regression is.**

**I think that's the one you're referring to, but not.**

**Oh, that's the regular one, I think. Right.**

**I mean, I don't know.**

**I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This one. Yeah, this is the regular one. Yeah, that's the one that we just have as a default here. And it will tell you some of the metrics you have here and it'll automatically run the analysis. Oh, that's so cool. Give you these little summaries. Is this something that you would actually use though?**

**Yeah, no, I would totally use this. I guess my one thing is, especially for the regression, having different types of visualizations, at least. I... Like, I mean, I mentioned I'm like a visual learner and that, you know, until I actually like saw The visualization of the K-means clustering, I didn't understand it was wrong or why it was meaningless. And I think having multiple options to visualize or maybe multiple different types of visualizations for the same analysis.**

**multiple different types of visualizations for the same that makes sense to me depending what it is like you know histogram or like what is a violin plot like they have yeah oh you know what that is oh my god okay yeah i hate them but i know what that is i don't know how to read them they're so confusing to me cool okay now a little bit of a direct questionOkay. Would you actually pay for this? Yeah.**

**Really?**

**Like if I said right now, like I'll give you this right now. How much would you pay for this? If I said like 10 bucks, like a month, would you pay for it?**

**Oh yeah. 10 bucks a month. Yeah.**

**Really? Right now? Yeah. All right. That won't be 10 bucks.**

**You'd have to add the visualizations. Okay, cool.**

**Um, okay.**

**But yeah, I would absolutely, I mean, I spend more on Claude per month.**

**I would totally do 10 bucks a month for this. Awesome.**

**Okay. Um, I'll talk to you more about the visualizations some other time. But in the meantime, is there anyone that you think would actually be interested? Is like doing things that are similar to you maybe doesn't have like as deep a stat background and is going through the same process of trying to code up their analyses by scratch, taking like forever to do that and maybe would benefit from something like this.**

**Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm for my I'm in the for my thesis. I have to take this like senior seminar and everyone in there is also doing a thesis.**

**Yeah. I could bring it up in that class, actually.**

**Yeah, if you could send me some context, that would be awesome.**

**you need to like interview them more or like interview more people or like, what is it?**

**Yeah. I just love to chat with more people. I won't, I chatted with you for like 50 minutes now, it seems, but like, that's cause like, I know you, um, I won't bore them this much, but like, I'm just curious about, um, what what parts different people actually struggle with in the process and maybe like that would influence the direction where we actually build this productHmm, yeah, no, this is super cool.**

**Keep me updated on this.**

**I'm very excited to hear about this.**

**Yeah, bet, okay.**

**Yeah, this is really cool. I would totally use it just, More visualizations, please. I do approve of the light mode, though.**

**We will. I think one of the first things he did was make a dark mode. I don't know how to turn it on, but we can keep the light mode for you. We got it.**

**Okay. Yeah, it's blind in my eyes.**

**Okay, cool. Awesome. Yeah, if you could send me those, like, other people you think might be doing something similar to you.**

**Yeah, I'll bring them tomorrow in my class. I have class at 10, and we, like, always go through, like, updates in the beginning of the class about my progress.**

**So it's a perfect time to talk about it.**

**Cool. Awesome. All right. Okay, I'll keep you updated with how this goes. Thanks for giving me so much of your time.**

**And you can do Friday, because I need... Yes. Oh, giving you, like, a rundown of what I need. Yeah, yeah. So I... One of my research assistants will be doing kind of like not like a mock data collection, but like technically actual data collection on you. but I'll be critiquing her in person. I see. That's why. Yeah. So, um, and then there'll be another, the other research assistant will be watching because she's training.**

**So yeah, I can do a Friday, 1130. Yeah, works for me. I might have to run over Um, cause I will be caught alone 15, but I should, I should be fine. Yeah.**

**That's fine. Uh, yeah. Cool. That's fine. Uh, yeah. Cool. all good okay cool bad okay awesome thank you so much yeah you're no problem bye take care**
