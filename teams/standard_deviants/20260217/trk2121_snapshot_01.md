### What was learned:
- Who: 
	- Research director at non-profit in NYC
- Problem confirmed: 
	- Not directly. Adjacent problem areas and interesting areas outside current scope. 
- Key quotes:
	 - Interviewee permission requested. 
- Emotional intensity: 
	- Ranging from 1/2 to 7/8 depending on the topic and the frustration it brings about.
- Current solution: 
	- Microsoft Office, Word & Excel and email. Manual checks by Research Director across a variety of responsibilities (context, proper attribution of direct quotes and ideas, ). They do not perform statistical or quantitative analysis directly, but reference primary sources in their write-ups. They do not perform inter-rater reliability, or have a systematic approach to qualitative coding. Version control is a serious issue unsolved by current solution.
- Money spent: 
	- No, but primarily because of privacy/security concerns, not a lack of need. They have looked at a few products, but found either the privacy/security situation untenable or found the software unintuitive with a high likelihood of friction in adoption that outweighed potential benefits. 

### Reaction + Commitments
- Solution reaction: 
	- I did not pitch a “solution”, I listened. I identified problem spaces adjacent to the current Implementation of my “solution” but there was sparse direct overlap between those identified and the current implementation. 
- Biggest concerns: 
	- Privacy and security, followed by ease of use for themselves and their team. It can’t get in the way/cause friction.
- Referral: 
	- Forgot to ask.
- Follow up: 
	- Yes.
- Surprises/Contradiction of assumptions:
	- Not really. I know this person and her research is similar but not identical to the researchers our “solution” would currently serve as is (ie. her research team focuses on using primary sources, FOIA/FOIL, and MuckRock instead of collecting, cleaning, and analyzing their own data)
- Signal: Yellow
