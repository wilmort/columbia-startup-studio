Key Quote:
“Um no I was learning but lowkey half of it can be done through ai. I used ai more so
for what it's called- I forgot the word... like fixing errors.”
Emotional intensity:
7, mainly since AI was very helpful, but 9 when talking about her preference for Excel over Sheets.
Current solution:
Use AI to help maneuver confusing bits or have it do the analysis for her.
Money Spent:
None, her campus pays for most of it.
Surprise:
She said “I’d get a 9-5 that pays for it. (basically never pay out of pocket for it). I love it so much
I’d break the law to get it.” which surprised me on the topic of why she prefers Excel so much over
Google Sheets.

Their reaction:
Very neutral to the concept (because I wasn’t able to show off the software itself).
Key quote:
“Maybe I'd consider it if I knew more about it”.
Biggest concern:
Doesn’t already pay out of pocket for Excel and the like, so the software would need to be popular with
management over personal use.
