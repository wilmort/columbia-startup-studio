# Interview Summary — Interviewee 01 × Idea 01 (RadiusCart)

## Idea
**RadiusCart** = cheapest grocery bucket / price + effort tradeoff.

## What they do today
- Shops across **Kroger / Trader Joe’s / Costco** depending on what they need.
- Often lacks time to run errands; likely does periodic bulk runs + fill-in trips.

## Problem confirmed?
- **Yes (implicit).** They experience fragmentation across stores.

## Pain points / friction
- **Not everything is available in one store.**
- Deals exist but aren’t consistent/easy to track.

## Current workaround
- Store-hopping + mental heuristics (Costco vs TJ vs Kroger depending on category).

## Emotional intensity
- **5/10** (practical annoyance more than frustration).

## Signal / willingness
- They didn’t “vote” money toward this (they went all-in on Idea 3), but the **one-store consolidation** pain is real.
