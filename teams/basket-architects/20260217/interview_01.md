# Interview 01 – Strawberry Purchase Case (NJ Shopper)

## Raw Notes
- Lives in NJ; compares Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods
- Prefers Trader Joe’s for value + consistent quality
- Needed strawberries recently
- Many stores were out of stock → only low-quality/rotten ones left
- Other grocery items also frequently go out of stock
- Bought from Whole Foods → expensive + partly rotten → felt overpaid
- Hard to compare prices across stores in real time
- Relies on memory rather than exact comparison
- Tried online grocery → inconsistent produce quality → prefers in-person
