  "researchers_stance": "V1 is a massive lift from baseline across every metric \u2014 conversion from 7% to 43%, resonance from 17% to 58%, clarity from 0% to 88% nailed_it. The brand voice is working. However, two critical gaps emerged: fomo_scroller has a 75% resonance / 17% conversion gap (they love the concept but the backward-looking copy doesn't serve their forward-looking need), and journal_graveyard is stuck at 17% (retention concerns are unsolved). Network believability at 62% is the breakout metric \u2014 this is the product's differentiator.",
  "exec_summary": "First real copy version tested. Identity-driven hero ('Your social life, ranked'), specific examples (8/10 Thai place), one-tap emphasis, network discovery section. All metrics lifted massively from baseline. Two structural gaps identified: fomo_scroller needs forward-looking reframe, journal_graveyard needs retention proof.",
  "findings": "<ul><li><strong>+36pp conversion lift validates the baseline approach</strong>: V1 at 43% vs baseline 7%. The floor was real, the lift is real.</li><li><strong>Network discovery is the breakout concept</strong>: 62% believability \u2014 highest metric. Friend-powered discovery resonates more than the personal journal framing.</li><li><strong>Resonance-conversion gap in fomo_scroller</strong>: 75% resonance but only 17% conversion. They love the concept but the copy is backward-looking ('record what you did'). They need 'discover what to do next.'</li><li><strong>Clarity at 88% nailed_it</strong>: The specific examples and Beli comparison communicate the product clearly. Major improvement from 0%.</li><li><strong>Price perception improved</strong>: 'too expensive' dropped from 50% to 23%. Value framing makes $12/month feel justified.</li></ul>",
  "recommendations": "<ol><li><strong>Reframe hero for forward-looking discovery</strong>: Add 'discover what's next' to subhead for fomo_scroller.</li><li><strong>Add retention section</strong>: Address journal_graveyard's 'I'll abandon this in a week' concern directly.</li><li><strong>Address cold-start</strong>: Multiple buckets ask 'what if I'm the first of my friends?' Add pre-network value paragraph.</li><li><strong>Soften paywall</strong>: Social features behind Pro creates a catch-22. Add basic friend activity to free.</li><li><strong>Add referral incentive</strong>: Align business model with network growth.</li></ol>",
  "qualitative_themes": "<ul><li><strong>Memory framing lands universally</strong> (28 mentions): 'Hundreds of places, remember twenty' is the most-cited problem statement.</li><li><strong>'One tap' is critical</strong> (22 mentions): Especially for journal_graveyard. The effortlessness claim is the entry point.</li><li><strong>Network discovery excites</strong> (31 mentions): 'Friends' picks over algorithms' is the differentiator personas respond to most.</li><li><strong>Cold-start concern</strong> (15 mentions): 'What if none of my friends use this?' across 4 of 5 buckets.</li><li><strong>Social paywall objection</strong> (12 mentions): 'Don't gate the social features behind Pro \u2014 the network can't grow.'</li></ul>",
  "clarity_notes": "88% nailed_it, 10% partial, 2% wrong. Major improvement. The Beli comparison and specific examples communicate the product clearly.",

  "bucket_deep_dives": {
    "taste_curator": "<h4>58% conversion \u2014 strong start</h4><p>The specific rating examples (8/10 Thai place) proved the team 'gets it.' Taste analytics in Pro need more specificity.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> High-skepticism personas still cite 'need to see the interface.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Removing specific examples would hurt this bucket.</p>",
    "social_connector": "<h4>50% conversion \u2014 resonance-conversion gap</h4><p>75% resonance but 50% conversion. They love the concept but worry friends won't join and social features are paywalled.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> Social evangelists who need a free social tier and a referral incentive to convert.</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> If paywall isn't softened, this bucket plateaus.</p>",
    "journal_graveyard": "<h4>17% conversion \u2014 toughest bucket</h4><p>Down from 58% dealbreakers (baseline) to 25%, which is progress. But retention fears dominate. They need to believe this time will be different.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> Every persona cites past app abandonment. Copy must acknowledge this directly.</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> May be a structural 50% ceiling bucket. Copy can reduce friction but can't change behavior.</p>",
    "fomo_scroller": "<h4>17% conversion \u2014 biggest gap, biggest opportunity</h4><p>75% resonance proves the audience is right. 17% conversion proves the framing is wrong. They need forward-looking discovery ('what to do next'), not backward-looking recording ('rate what you did').</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> 'V1 told me to record my life. I need help upgrading it.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> If V2 doesn't add forward-looking framing, this bucket stays at 17%.</p>",
    "city_explorer": "<h4>75% conversion \u2014 strongest bucket</h4><p>Highest conversion, lowest dealbreakers (8%). The product-audience fit is strong. Cold-start concern is the main friction.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> Recently relocated, actively building their city map.</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Cold-start must be addressed to push above 75%.</p>"
