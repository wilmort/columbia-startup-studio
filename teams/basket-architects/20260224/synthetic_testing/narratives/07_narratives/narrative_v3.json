  "researchers_stance": "V3 proved what's expendable and what's load-bearing. Trimming ~20% helped some buckets (fomo_scroller surged to 75%) but hurt others (journal_graveyard crashed, city_explorer dropped 34pp). This round's primary value is diagnostic: it identified exactly which content elements drive conversion so V4 can make a data-driven hybrid. Annual pricing and taste analytics specificity were unambiguous wins.",
  "exec_summary": "Trimmed ~20% of page length. fomo_scroller surged (+25pp conv) and price perception hit best-ever. But journal_graveyard resonance crashed 25pp from removing the honesty line, and city_explorer conversion dropped 34pp from shortening cold-start context. V3's value is diagnostic: it proves which content is load-bearing.",
  "findings": "<ul><li><strong>Page length was hurting fomo_scroller</strong>: 50% \u2192 75% conversion from trimming alone. Shorter page = less friction for mobile scrollers.</li><li><strong>Honesty line was load-bearing</strong>: Removing 'most apps die after a week. We know that.' crashed journal_graveyard resonance 25pp. Must be restored.</li><li><strong>Cold-start context was load-bearing</strong>: Shortening city_explorer's cold-start from 4 sentences to 1 dropped conversion from 92% to 58%. Punchline alone isn't enough.</li><li><strong>Specific examples were load-bearing</strong>: Removing '8/10 Thai place' dropped taste_curator conversion 8pp.</li><li><strong>$99/year was an unambiguous win</strong>: 'Too expensive' dropped from 27% to 17%. Best price perception ever.</li><li><strong>Taste analytics specificity landed</strong>: 'Neighborhoods, friend comparisons, category pickiness' drove taste_curator to 92% resonance.</li></ul>",
  "recommendations": "<ol><li><strong>Restore the honesty line</strong> in the retention section opening.</li><li><strong>Restore the specific rating examples</strong> as a single compact line in the solution section.</li><li><strong>Expand cold-start to 2 sentences</strong> (not back to 4). Right-size the context around 'first it's your map.'</li><li><strong>Keep the tighter problem section</strong>. The merged fomo_scroller paragraph is driving their best results.</li><li><strong>Keep annual pricing and taste analytics specificity.</strong> Unambiguous wins.</li></ol>",
  "qualitative_themes": "<ul><li><strong>Missing the honesty line</strong> (4 mentions, journal_graveyard): 'That was the most honest thing I'd read on a landing page.'</li><li><strong>Shorter page is better for mobile</strong> (6 mentions, fomo_scroller/city_explorer): 'I read every word without skimming.'</li><li><strong>$99/year is the right anchor</strong> (5 mentions): 'Annual signals commitment. Monthly felt tentative.'</li><li><strong>Taste analytics detail sells Pro</strong> (3 mentions, taste_curator): 'Which neighborhoods I rate highest \u2014 that's the data I want.'</li></ul>",

    "taste_curator": "<h4>67% conversion (-8pp), 92% resonance (+9pp), 0% dealbreakers (-17pp)</h4><p>Highest resonance yet but conversion dipped from losing the specific examples. Taste analytics specificity was the resonance driver.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> 'I miss the 8/10 Thai place. Those examples proved someone who thinks like me built this.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Must restore examples in V4.</p>",
    "social_connector": "<h4>67% conversion (-8pp), 100% resonance, 0% dealbreakers</h4><p>Perfect resonance. Conversion dipped modestly \u2014 product experience is now the variable, not copy.</p>",
    "journal_graveyard": "<h4>33% conversion (-9pp), 25% resonance (-25pp) \ud83d\udd34</h4><p>Removing the honesty line was a mistake. Resonance crashed. The three-month testimonial partially compensates but doesn't replace the direct acknowledgment.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> 'I noticed the honesty line is gone. I respected that.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> MUST restore. This is the clearest load-bearing signal in the study.</p>",
    "fomo_scroller": "<h4>75% conversion (+25pp) \u2b50 Biggest V3 winner</h4><p>The tighter page is dramatically better for mobile scrollers. Conversion surged to 75%.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> 'This version MOVES. I read the whole thing without losing interest.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Don't re-expand this bucket's critical sections.</p>",
    "city_explorer": "<h4>58% conversion (-34pp) \ud83d\udd34 Biggest V3 loser</h4><p>Punchy one-liner doesn't do enough without context. The longer cold-start explanation was doing more work than expected.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> 'The standalone line is powerful but doesn't fully address my concern.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Must restore 2-sentence context in V4.</p>"
