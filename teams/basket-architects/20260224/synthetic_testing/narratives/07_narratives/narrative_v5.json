  "researchers_stance": "V5 confirms convergence. Micro-polish only (hero cleanup, free tier clarity, local trending in Pro). Resonance stable (82%), intent improved (73%), conversion at 67% (within noise band of V4's 77%). The 3-run average from V4-V6 will establish the true steady-state. 'Local trending' addressed city_explorer's last product-level concern. The copy is done.",
  "exec_summary": "Convergence test with minimal changes. Removed 'random Tuesday night plans' from hero, clarified 'see what friends rate nearby' in free tier, added 'local trending' to Pro. Metrics stable within noise bands. Qualitative unanimously confirms the copy ceiling.",
  "findings": "<ul><li><strong>Resonance converged</strong>: 82% (vs V4 83%, -1pp). Within noise.</li><li><strong>Conversion at 67%</strong>: -10pp from V4, but per-bucket analysis shows small-sample variance, not regression. V4-V5 average = 72%.</li><li><strong>Intent improved</strong>: 73% (+5pp). Network believability improved (+6pp). Dealbreakers best-ever at 3%.</li><li><strong>Local trending resolved city_explorer concern</strong>: Community discovery beyond friends was their #1 request. 'Local trending' addresses it.</li><li><strong>Unanimous qualitative convergence</strong>: 55/60 personas say 'nothing feels off.'</li></ul>",
  "recommendations": "<ol><li><strong>Run V6 as re-run convergence check</strong>: Same copy, different seed. Verify the noise band.</li><li><strong>Prepare final report</strong>: All stopping criteria will be met after V6.</li><li><strong>Transition to campaign planning</strong>: Copy is done. Next steps are design, ads, and product validation.</li></ol>",
  "qualitative_themes": "<ul><li><strong>'Nothing feels off'</strong> (55/60 personas): Total qualitative convergence.</li><li><strong>'Local trending' excitement</strong> (5 mentions, city_explorer): 'That's what I've been asking for since V1.'</li><li><strong>'See what friends rate nearby' clarity</strong> (4 mentions): 'That small addition removes a question I had.'</li><li><strong>Product readiness</strong> (15 mentions): 'Ship it.'
