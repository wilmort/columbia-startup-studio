Its purpose is to calibrate the floor so that V1 gains can be validated as real rather than AI grading generosity. The 7% conversion confirms the floor is low enough to be useful.",
  "exec_summary": "Tested a deliberately mediocre landing page ('Track Your Experiences \u2014 Remember Everything You Do') against 60 personas across 5 buckets. Conversion was 7%, resonance 17%, clarity nailed_it 0%. This establishes the scoring floor for all subsequent rounds.",
  "findings": "<ul><li><strong>Floor established at 7% conversion</strong>: Low enough to validate V1 lifts as genuine. Any version scoring above 15% is demonstrably better than generic copy.</li><li><strong>Clarity at 0% nailed_it</strong>: No persona correctly identified what the product does. Generic framing ('Track Your Experiences') could describe 50 apps.</li><li><strong>Fake testimonials detected</strong>: Multiple personas flagged social proof as 'obvious marketing copy' and 'generic.' Synthetic users catch inauthenticity.</li><li><strong>Price anchoring failed</strong>: 50% rated pricing 'too expensive' \u2014 without value framing, $12/month feels arbitrary.</li></ul>",
  "recommendations": "<ol><li><strong>Replace generic hero with identity-driven framing</strong>: 'Your social life, ranked' or equivalent \u2014 something only this product could say.</li><li><strong>Write specific copy</strong>: Use concrete examples (ratings, categories, scenarios) instead of abstract claims.</li><li><strong>Add real brand voice</strong>: The baseline reads like a template. The product has a distinctive voice \u2014 use it.</li><li><strong>Fix testimonials</strong>: Replace generic quotes with specific, situation-driven social proof.</li></ol>",
  "qualitative_themes": "<ul><li><strong>Generic / could be any app</strong> (42 mentions): 'This sounds like every other tracking app.' 'Nothing distinguishes it.'</li><li><strong>Fake testimonials</strong> (18 mentions): 'These don't sound like real people.' 'Obviously written by marketing.'</li><li><strong>Unclear what it actually does</strong> (35 mentions): 'Is this a journal? A review site? A recommendation engine?'</li><li><strong>Price without value</strong> (22 mentions): 'Why would I pay for this when Google Maps is free?'</li></ul>",

    "taste_curator": "<h4>0% conversion \u2014 nothing to work with</h4><p>Generic copy fails to signal that this product is built for people who think in ratings. No specificity, no data, no analytics mention.</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> If V1 doesn't add concrete rating examples, this bucket stays dead.</p>",
    "social_connector": "<h4>0% conversion \u2014 social pitch absent</h4><p>The baseline doesn't mention friend networks, sharing, or social discovery. The core value prop for this bucket is invisible.</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Social features need to be front and center in V1.</p>",
    "journal_graveyard": "<h4>0% conversion, 58% dealbreakers</h4><p>Highest dealbreaker rate. Every friction signal ('write reviews', 'log entries') activates their abandonment reflex. They need to see 'one tap' and 'no effort' immediately.</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Structural bucket \u2014 may never exceed 50% even with perfect copy.</p>",
    "fomo_scroller": "<h4>8% conversion \u2014 one accidental near-hit</h4><p>The baseline's 'remember everything' framing accidentally touches their need, but backward-looking. They need forward-looking: 'discover what to do next.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> If V1 remains backward-looking, this bucket stays flat.</p>",
    "city_explorer": "<h4>25% conversion \u2014 best baseline bucket</h4><p>Even generic copy partially serves their acute need for recommendations in a new city. But 25% is still low \u2014 they need cold-start reassurance and local discovery framing.</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Easiest bucket to convert. If V1 doesn't hit 50%+ here, something is wrong.</p>"
