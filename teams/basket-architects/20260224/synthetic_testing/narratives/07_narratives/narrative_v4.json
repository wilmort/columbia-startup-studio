  "researchers_stance": "V4 is the best version across every metric. The selective restoration strategy \u2014 adding back exactly what V3's data proved was load-bearing \u2014 delivered 77% conversion, 83% resonance, 8% dealbreakers. This confirms that data-driven editing beats both aggressive cutting (V3) and kitchen-sink inclusion (V2). The qualitative feedback has converged: 'my objections are about the product, not the copy.' We're approaching the copy ceiling.",
  "exec_summary": "Hybrid of V3's tighter structure with surgical restoration of three load-bearing elements: the honesty line (journal_graveyard), specific rating examples (taste_curator), and cold-start context (city_explorer). Every metric hit its best-ever value. Qualitative feedback converged to 'the copy is done.'",
  "findings": "<ul><li><strong>77% conversion \u2014 best ever</strong>: +17pp from V3, +10pp from V2. The hybrid strategy outperforms both pure cutting and pure adding.</li><li><strong>journal_graveyard breakthrough</strong>: 50% conversion (from 33% V3). Resonance tripled (25%\u219275%) confirming the honesty line is load-bearing.</li><li><strong>fomo_scroller maintained</strong>: 83% conversion \u2014 nothing that helped them was touched. Protected correctly.</li><li><strong>city_explorer recovered</strong>: 92% conversion (from 58% V3). Two-sentence cold-start is the right balance.</li><li><strong>Qualitative convergence</strong>: Personas saying 'the page is done, now I need to try the product.' All remaining objections are product-level.</li></ul>",
  "recommendations": "<ol><li><strong>Run V5 as convergence test</strong>: Minimal changes to verify V4 is stable, not a lucky roll.</li><li><strong>Micro-polish only</strong>: Remove 'random Tuesday night plans' (flagged as forced), clarify 'basic friend activity' in free tier, replace vague 'priority in local discovery.'</li><li><strong>Do not add new sections</strong>: The page is at its natural length. Any addition risks fomo_scroller regression.</li></ol>",
  "qualitative_themes": "<ul><li><strong>'The copy is done'</strong> (12 mentions): Across all buckets. Objections are product-level, not copy-level.</li><li><strong>'Ship it'</strong> (8 mentions): Strongest convergence signal. Personas have stopped evaluating and started wanting to try.</li><li><strong>Product-level requests dominate</strong> (20+ mentions): Screenshots, invite flow, user counts, passive tracking \u2014 all beyond copy's scope.</li><li><strong>Honesty restored, trust returned</strong> (5 mentions, journal_graveyard): 'The honesty is back and I trust the page again.'</li></ul>",

    "taste_curator": "<h4>75% conversion (recovered), 100% resonance, 0% dealbreakers</h4><p>Restored examples recovered conversion to V2's peak. 100% resonance means the copy perfectly connects with every persona.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> 'The examples are back and they make the whole concept tangible again.'</p>",
    "social_connector": "<h4>83% conversion (best ever), 0% dealbreakers</h4><p>Best conversion ever for this bucket. Zero dealbreakers for 3 consecutive rounds. Objections are entirely product-level.</p>",
    "journal_graveyard": "<h4>50% conversion (breakthrough), 75% resonance (+50pp from V3)</h4><p>Most dramatic per-bucket improvement of the entire study. The honesty line is confirmed load-bearing.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> 'My remaining skepticism is about myself, not the product.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> 8% dealbreakers are structural (no passive tracking). Copy ceiling reached.</p>",
    "fomo_scroller": "<h4>83% conversion (+8pp), 83% resonance (+16pp)</h4><p>From 17% V1 to 83% V4 \u2014 biggest conversion journey of any bucket. Forward-looking reframe + tight page + restored examples each contributed.</p>",
    "city_explorer": "<h4>92% conversion (recovered), 75% resonance</h4><p>Fully recovered to V2's peak. Two-sentence cold-start explanation is the right balance. 25% dealbreakers are all requesting community discovery beyond friends.</p>"
