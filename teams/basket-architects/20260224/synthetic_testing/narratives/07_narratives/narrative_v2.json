  "researchers_stance": "V2 crossed the 50% conversion threshold (67%) with targeted changes responding to V1's data. The forward-looking reframe tripled fomo_scroller conversion (17%\u219250%). The referral incentive and free social activity closed the social_connector gap. journal_graveyard doubled (17%\u219242%) but 25% dealbreakers persist \u2014 these are structural. The page is getting long, which matters for mobile traffic. Trimming is the V3 priority.",
  "exec_summary": "Targeted V1's two biggest gaps: added forward-looking discovery angle for fomo_scroller and retention section for journal_graveyard. Also added referral incentive, free friend activity, and cold-start paragraph. Conversion hit 67%, crossing the 50% threshold. All buckets improved. Page length is a new concern.",
  "findings": "<ul><li><strong>Forward-looking reframe tripled fomo_scroller</strong>: 17% \u2192 50% conversion. 'Discover what's next' in the hero subhead was the single highest-leverage change.</li><li><strong>Referral incentive closed social_connector gap</strong>: 50% \u2192 75% conversion, 0% dealbreakers. 'Invite 3 friends \u2192 free Pro month' aligned business model with product growth.</li><li><strong>Retention section moved journal_graveyard</strong>: 17% \u2192 42%. 'Most apps die after a week. We know that.' earned trust through honesty.</li><li><strong>city_explorer hit 92%</strong>: Cold-start paragraph ('first it's your map') resolved their primary concern.</li><li><strong>Page length concern emerging</strong>: Multiple personas mention mobile reading experience. V3 should trim ~20%.</li></ul>",
  "recommendations": "<ol><li><strong>Trim ~20% of page length</strong>: Protect conversion-driving content, cut supporting detail. Priority: tighten problem section, shorten cold-start explanation.</li><li><strong>Add annual pricing</strong>: 4+ personas requested $99/year option.</li><li><strong>Specify taste analytics</strong>: Replace vague 'taste analytics' with concrete descriptions.</li><li><strong>Monitor network believability dip</strong>: -7pp from V1. May be noise, may be dilution from longer page.</li></ol>",
  "qualitative_themes": "<ul><li><strong>'Choosing feels like work' is a new anchor line</strong> (5 mentions): Added in V2, immediately resonates with fomo_scroller.</li><li><strong>'First it's your map' is the city_explorer anchor</strong> (7 mentions): Most-cited line overall. Solo\u2192social journey in one sentence.</li><li><strong>Honesty about retention earns trust</strong> (4 mentions): journal_graveyard specifically responds to 'we know apps die after a week.'</li><li><strong>Page length concern</strong> (8 mentions): 'Getting long for mobile.' Especially from fomo_scroller and city_explorer (action-oriented).</li><li><strong>Objections shifting to product-level</strong> (6 mentions): 'I need to see the interface' \u2014 healthy signal that copy is approaching its ceiling.</li></ul>",

  "bucket_deep_dives": {
    "taste_curator": "<h4>75% conversion (+17pp)</h4><p>Steady improvement. 83% resonance shows strong connection. Taste analytics vagueness is the remaining friction.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> Want specifics: 'which neighborhoods, which categories.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Removing the specific examples would hurt this bucket.</p>",
    "social_connector": "<h4>75% conversion (+25pp), 0% dealbreakers</h4><p>Referral incentive + free social tier was the unlock. Resonance-conversion gap from V1 is closed. Objections are now product-level only.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> Ready to evangelize. 'I'd have 3 friends on this within a week.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> None from copy. Product invite flow quality is the remaining variable.</p>",
    "journal_graveyard": "<h4>42% conversion (+25pp), 25% dealbreakers</h4><p>Doubled but dealbreakers are structural. No passive tracking = guaranteed eventual abandonment for some personas.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> 'The honesty earned my try. Whether I stick with it is on me.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> 25% dealbreaker floor may be structural. Copy can't solve behavior change.</p>",
    "fomo_scroller": "<h4>50% conversion (+33pp) \u2014 biggest single-round gain</h4><p>Forward-looking reframe was the exact right change. 'V1 told me to record my life. V2 tells me to upgrade it.'</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> Discovery-driven. They want Saturday plans, not Monday journals.</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Page length is hurting this mobile-first audience.</p>",
    "city_explorer": "<h4>92% conversion (+17pp) \u2014 near ceiling</h4><p>11 of 12 personas would convert. Cold-start paragraph was the final piece.</p><p><strong>Key personas:</strong> 'The page addresses my situation perfectly without naming it specifically.'</p><p><strong>Risk:</strong> Community discovery beyond friends is the remaining product request.</p>"
